# MagicPrompt - Dall-E 2

This is a model from the MagicPrompt series of models, which are [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) models intended to generate prompt texts for imaging AIs, in this case: [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

## üñºÔ∏è Here's an example:

This model was trained with a set of about 26k of data filtered and extracted from various places such as: [The Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labs.openai.com/s/*), [The SubReddit for Dall-E 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2) and [dalle2.gallery](https://dalle2.gallery/#search). This may be a relatively small dataset, but we have to consider that Dall-E 2 is a closed service and we only have prompts from people who share it and have access to the service, for now. The set was trained with about 40,000 steps and I have plans to improve the model if possible.

If you want to test the model with a demo, you can go to: "[spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Dalle](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Dalle)".
