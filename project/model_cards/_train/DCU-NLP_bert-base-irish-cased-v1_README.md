# bert-base-irish-cased-v1

[gaBERT](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.511/) is a BERT-base model trained on 7.9M Irish sentences. For more details, including the hyperparameters and pretraining corpora used please refer to our paper.

## Model description

Encoder-based Transformer to be used to obtain features for finetuning for downstream tasks in Irish.

## Intended uses & limitations

Some data used to pretrain gaBERT was scraped from the web which potentially contains ethically problematic text (bias, hate, adult content, etc.). Consequently, downstream tasks/applications using gaBERT should be thoroughly tested with respect to ethical considerations.


### Training hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters were used during training:
- optimizer: None
- training_precision: float32



### Framework versions

- Transformers 4.20.1
- TensorFlow 2.9.1
- Datasets 2.3.2
- Tokenizers 0.12.1

    abstract = "The BERT family of neural language models have become highly popular due to their ability to provide sequences of text with rich context-sensitive token encodings which are able to generalise well to many NLP tasks. We introduce gaBERT, a monolingual BERT model for the Irish language. We compare our gaBERT model to multilingual BERT and the monolingual Irish WikiBERT, and we show that gaBERT provides better representations for a downstream parsing task. We also show how different filtering criteria, vocabulary size and the choice of subword tokenisation model affect downstream performance. We compare the results of fine-tuning a gaBERT model with an mBERT model for the task of identifying verbal multiword expressions, and show that the fine-tuned gaBERT model also performs better at this task. We release gaBERT and related code to the community.",
