# Legal act Extraction Model

With growing legal complexity keeping track of changes in interconnectivity and hierarchical structure of the legislation is a challenging task. Entity extraction technique (also known as token classification) facilitates document analysis by assigning a label to each word in a text. 

A way to decide which data elements are to be extracted and how they should be labeled mostly depends on a particular business problem and is limited only by a tokenization process meaning that an element shouldnâ€™t be less than a token as split by a tokenizer. So as long as these data elements correspond to at least one whole token they could represent legal terms, legal entities, legal parties, deadlines and so on. 

This model is fine-tuned to label mentioned legal acts and their articles. Extracted information could be used to create an interconnectivity map for legal acts.

## Intended Uses & Limitations 
The model could be used to extract mentioned legal acts and their articles.

### Limitations
This legal-act extraction model is very domain-specific and will perform well on legal texts. It's not recommended to use this model for other domains, but you are free to test it out.
It was intended for English documents only.

### How To Use
```python
from transformers import (
    TokenClassificationPipeline,
    RobertaForTokenClassification,
    RobertaTokenizerFast,
)

legal_act_extraction_model = RobertaForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(
    'Lexemo/roberta_large_legal_act_extraction')
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-large")
pypeline = TokenClassificationPipeline(model=legal_act_extraction_model, 
                                        tokenizer=tokenizer, 
                                        aggregation_strategy='simple')

```
```python
# Inference
import pandas as pd
from tabulate import tabulate

text = """When Member States adopt those measures, they shall contain a 
reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such reference on the 
occasion of their official publication. They shall also include a statement 
that references in existing laws, regulations and administrative provisions 
to Article 9 of Directive 97/23/EC shall be construed as references to 
Article 13 of this Directive. Member States shall determine how such 
reference is to be made and how that statement is to be formulated."""

entities = pypeline(text)
df = pd.DataFrame(entities)
print(tabulate(df, showindex=True, headers=df.columns))
```

```
