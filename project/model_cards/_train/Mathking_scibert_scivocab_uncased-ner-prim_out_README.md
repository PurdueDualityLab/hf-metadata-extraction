# Scibert Finetuned for Primary Outcomes extraction in Biomedical Text


## Model description
SciBERT (Scivocab Uncased Version) finetuned on dataset from A. Koroleva ).
This model is trained to detect primary outcomes (token classification) in biomedical articles.

## Intended uses & limitations
This model was trained to detect primary outcomes in medical articles.

## Training data
[Dataset from A. Koroleva](https://zenodo.org/record/3234811#.YnodlVzP2EI)

## Evaluation results
Here are the results from the different models evaluated. Evaluation is done using 10-fold cross validation using the 10 splits originally defined in the dataset.
