# gaELECTRA
[gaELECTRA](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.511/) is an ELECTRA model trained on 7.9M Irish sentences. For more details, including the hyperparameters and pretraining corpora used please refer to our paper. For fine-tuning this model on a token classification task, e.g. Named Entity Recognition, use the discriminator model.

### Limitations and bias
Some data used to pretrain gaBERT was scraped from the web which potentially contains ethically problematic text (bias, hate, adult content, etc.). Consequently, downstream tasks/applications using gaBERT should be thoroughly tested with respect to ethical considerations.

    abstract = "The BERT family of neural language models have become highly popular due to their ability to provide sequences of text with rich context-sensitive token encodings which are able to generalise well to many NLP tasks. We introduce gaBERT, a monolingual BERT model for the Irish language. We compare our gaBERT model to multilingual BERT and the monolingual Irish WikiBERT, and we show that gaBERT provides better representations for a downstream parsing task. We also show how different filtering criteria, vocabulary size and the choice of subword tokenisation model affect downstream performance. We compare the results of fine-tuning a gaBERT model with an mBERT model for the task of identifying verbal multiword expressions, and show that the fine-tuned gaBERT model also performs better at this task. We release gaBERT and related code to the community.",
