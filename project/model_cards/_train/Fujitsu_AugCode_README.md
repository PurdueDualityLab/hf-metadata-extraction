#  ðŸ”¥ Augmented Code Model ðŸ”¥
This is Augmented Code Model which is a fined-tune model of [CodeBERT](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/codebert-base) for processing of similarity between given docstring and code. This model is fined-model based on Augmented Code Corpus with ACS=4. 

## How to use the model ?
Similar to other huggingface model, you may load the model as follows.
```python

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Fujitsu/AugCode")

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("Fujitsu/AugCode")

```
Then you may use `model` to infer the similarity between a given docstring and code.
