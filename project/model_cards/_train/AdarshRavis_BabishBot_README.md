This is a text generation algorithm that is fine-tuned on subtitles from Binging with Babish (https://www.youtube.com/c/bingingwithbabish)


Just type in your starting sentence, click "compute" and see what the model has to say! The first time you run the model, it may take a minute to load (after that it takes ~6 seconds to run)


This is created with the help of aitextgen (https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen), using a pertained 124M gpt-2 model
