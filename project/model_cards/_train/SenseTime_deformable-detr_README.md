# Deformable DETR model with ResNet-50 backbone

Deformable DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model trained end-to-end on COCO 2017 object detection (118k annotated images). It was introduced in the paper [Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) by Zhu et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR). 

Disclaimer: The team releasing Deformable DETR did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

The DETR model is an encoder-decoder transformer with a convolutional backbone. Two heads are added on top of the decoder outputs in order to perform object detection: a linear layer for the class labels and a MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for the bounding boxes. The model uses so-called object queries to detect objects in an image. Each object query looks for a particular object in the image. For COCO, the number of object queries is set to 100. 

The model is trained using a "bipartite matching loss": one compares the predicted classes + bounding boxes of each of the N = 100 object queries to the ground truth annotations, padded up to the same length N (so if an image only contains 4 objects, 96 annotations will just have a "no object" as class and "no bounding box" as bounding box). The Hungarian matching algorithm is used to create an optimal one-to-one mapping between each of the N queries and each of the N annotations. Next, standard cross-entropy (for the classes) and a linear combination of the L1 and generalized IoU loss (for the bounding boxes) are used to optimize the parameters of the model.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for object detection. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=sensetime/deformable-detr) to look for all available Deformable DETR models.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model:

```python
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, DeformableDetrForObjectDetection
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("SenseTime/deformable-detr")
model = DeformableDetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("SenseTime/deformable-detr")

inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API
# let's only keep detections with score > 0.7
target_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])
results = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.7)[0]

for score, label, box in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"], results["boxes"]):
    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
    print(
            f"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence "
            f"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}"
    )
```
This should output:
```
Detected cat with confidence 0.856 at location [342.19, 24.3, 640.02, 372.25]
Detected remote with confidence 0.739 at location [40.79, 72.78, 176.76, 117.25]
Detected cat with confidence 0.859 at location [16.5, 52.84, 318.25, 470.78]
```

Currently, both the feature extractor and model support PyTorch. 

## Training data

The Deformable DETR model was trained on [COCO 2017 object detection](https://cocodataset.org/#download), a dataset consisting of 118k/5k annotated images for training/validation respectively.
