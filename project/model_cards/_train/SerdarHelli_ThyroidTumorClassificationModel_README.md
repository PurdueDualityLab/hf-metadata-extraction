Thyroid nodule is one of the most common endocrine carcinomas. Due to its higher reveal ability and ability to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules in pathological features, ultrasonography has become the most widely used modality for finding and diagnosing thyroid cancer when compared to CT and MRI.

In this study, the purpose is the classification of thyroid tumors on ultrasound images with 2 different categories:

- Malign(1)
- Benign(0)
