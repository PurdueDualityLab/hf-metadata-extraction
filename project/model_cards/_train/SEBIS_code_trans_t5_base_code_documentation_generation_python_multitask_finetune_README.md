# CodeTrans model for code documentation generation python
Pretrained model on programming language python using the t5 base model architecture. It was first released in
[this repository](https://github.com/agemagician/CodeTrans). This model is trained on tokenized python code functions: it works best with tokenized python functions.


## Model description

This CodeTrans model is based on the `t5-base` model. It has its own SentencePiece vocabulary model. It used multi-task training on 13 supervised tasks in the software development domain and 7 unsupervised datasets. It is then fine-tuned on the code documentation generation task for the python function/method.

## Intended uses & limitations

The model could be used to generate the description for the python function or be fine-tuned on other python code tasks. It can be used on unparsed and untokenized python code. However, if the python code is tokenized, the performance should be better.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model to generate python function documentation using Transformers SummarizationPipeline:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead, SummarizationPipeline

pipeline = SummarizationPipeline(
    model=AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("SEBIS/code_trans_t5_base_code_documentation_generation_python_multitask_finetune"),
    tokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("SEBIS/code_trans_t5_base_code_documentation_generation_python_multitask_finetune", skip_special_tokens=True),
    device=0
)

tokenized_code = "def e ( message , exit_code = None ) : print_log ( message , YELLOW , BOLD ) if exit_code is not None : sys . exit ( exit_code )"
pipeline([tokenized_code])
```
Run this example in [colab notebook](https://github.com/agemagician/CodeTrans/blob/main/prediction/multitask/fine-tuning/function%20documentation%20generation/python/base_model.ipynb).
## Training data

The supervised training tasks datasets can be downloaded on [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/488bq2of10r4wvw/AACs5CGIQuwtsD7j_Ls_JAORa/finetuning_dataset?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1)

## Training procedure

### Multi-task Pretraining

The model was trained on a single TPU Pod V3-8 for half million steps in total, using sequence length 512 (batch size 4096).
It has a total of approximately 220M parameters and was trained using the encoder-decoder architecture.
The optimizer used is AdaFactor with inverse square root learning rate schedule for pre-training.

### Fine-tuning

This model was then fine-tuned on a single TPU Pod V2-8 for 4000 steps in total, using sequence length 512 (batch size 256), using only the dataset only containing python code.


## Evaluation results

For the code documentation tasks, different models achieves the following results on different programming languages (in BLEU score):
