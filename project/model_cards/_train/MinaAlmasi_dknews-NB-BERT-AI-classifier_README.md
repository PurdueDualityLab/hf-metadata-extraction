# dknews-NB-BERT-AI-classifier/

This model is a fine-tuned version of [NbAiLab/nb-bert-large](https://huggingface.co/NbAiLab/nb-bert-large) on a custom dataset with Danish News articles either generated by GPT-3 or a Danish journalist from a large Danish news media. The task is then to classify whether the article is written by GPT-3 (label = 0) or human (label = 1) 

It achieves the following results on the evaluation set (the best model loaded i.e., after 2 epochs)
- Loss: 0.1804
- Accuracy: 0.9574
- F1: 0.9574
- Precision: 0.9576
- Recall: 0.9574
