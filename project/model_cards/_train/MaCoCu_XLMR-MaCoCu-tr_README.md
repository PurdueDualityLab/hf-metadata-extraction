# Model description

**XLMR-MaCoCu-tr** is a large pre-trained language model trained on **Turkish** texts. It was created by continuing training from the [XLM-RoBERTa-large](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large) model. It was developed as part of the [MaCoCu](https://macocu.eu/) project and only uses data that was crawled during the project. The main developer is [Rik van Noord](https://www.rikvannoord.nl/) from the University of Groningen.

XLMR-MaCoCu-tr was trained on 35GB of Turkish text, which is equal to 4.4B tokens. It was trained for 70,000 steps with a batch size of 1,024. It uses the same vocabulary as the original XLMR-large model.

The training and fine-tuning procedures are described in detail on our [Github repo](https://github.com/macocu/LanguageModels).

# How to use

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, TFAutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("RVN/XLMR-MaCoCu-tr")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("RVN/XLMR-MaCoCu-tr") # PyTorch
model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained("RVN/XLMR-MaCoCu-tr") # Tensorflow
```

# Data

For training, we used all Turkish data that was present in the monolingual Turkish [MaCoCu](https://macocu.eu/) corpus. After de-duplicating the data, we were left with a total of 35 GB of text, which equals 4.4 billion tokens.

# Benchmark performance

We tested the performance of **XLMR-MaCoCu-tr** on benchmarks of XPOS, UPOS and NER from the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) project. For COPA, we train on a machine translated (MT) set of the data (for details see our [Github repo](https://github.com/RikVN/COPA)), and evaluate on a similar MT set, but also on the human-translated (HT) test set from the [XCOPA](https://github.com/cambridgeltl/xcopa) project. We compare performance to the strong multi-lingual models XLMR-base and XLMR-large, but also to the monolingual [BERTurk](https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) model. For details regarding the fine-tuning procedure you can checkout our [Github](https://github.com/macocu/LanguageModels).

Scores are averages of three runs, except for COPA, for which we use 10 runs. We use the same hyperparameter settings for all models for POS/NER, for COPA we optimized each learning rate on the dev set.
