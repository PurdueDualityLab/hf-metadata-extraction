# Jeux2BERT

Jeux2BERT is a Flaubert language model augmented by the lexico-semantic network JeuxDeMots. 
Thus, this model tries to capture the distributional and relational properties of words, but also tries to discriminate the different relational properties between words or syntagms.

The Web application includes three Tasks : Link Prediction (Classification de triplets), Relation Prediction (Pr√©diction de Relation) and Triple Ranking (Classement de triplets)

The task Triple Ranking (Classement de triplets) don't run smoothly on the streamlit server because of the inference's time, so it's better to run it locally instead on the demo's server.
