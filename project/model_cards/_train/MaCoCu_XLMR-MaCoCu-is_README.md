# Model description

**XLMR-MaCoCu-is** is a large pre-trained language model trained on **Icelandic** texts. It was created by continuing training from the [XLM-RoBERTa-large](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-large) model. It was developed as part of the [MaCoCu](https://macocu.eu/) project and only uses data that was crawled during the project. The main developer is [Rik van Noord](https://www.rikvannoord.nl/) from the University of Groningen.

XLMR-MaCoCu-is was trained on 4.4GB of Icelandic text, which is equal to 688M tokens. It was trained for 75,000 steps with a batch size of 1,024. It uses the same vocabulary as the original XLMR-large model.

The training and fine-tuning procedures are described in detail on our [Github repo](https://github.com/macocu/LanguageModels).

# How to use

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, TFAutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("RVN/XLMR-MaCoCu-is")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("RVN/XLMR-MaCoCu-is") # PyTorch
model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained("RVN/XLMR-MaCoCu-is") # Tensorflow
```

# Data

For training, we used all Icelandic data that was present in the monolingual Icelandic [MaCoCu](https://macocu.eu/) corpus. After de-duplicating the data, we were left with a total of 4.4 GB of text, which equals 688M tokens.

# Benchmark performance

We tested the performance of **XLMR-MaCoCu-is** on benchmarks of XPOS, UPOS, NER and COPA. For UPOS and XPOS, we used the data from the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) project. For NER, we used the data from the MIM-GOLD-NER data set. For COPA, we automatically translated the English data set by using Google Translate. For details please see our [Github repo](https://github.com/RikVN/COPA). We compare performance to the strong multi-lingual models XLMR-base and XLMR-large, but also the monolingual [IceBERT](https://huggingface.co/vesteinn/IceBERT) model. For details regarding the XPOS/UPOS/NER fine-tuning procedure you can checkout our [Github](https://github.com/macocu/LanguageModels).

Scores are averages of three runs, except for COPA, for which we use 10 runs. We use the same hyperparameter settings for all models.
