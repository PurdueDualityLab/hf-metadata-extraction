# Model description
This is the T5-3B model for the "classify" component of System 4's "Classify then explain" pipeline, as described in our paper Just-DREAM-about-it: Figurative Language Understanding with DREAM-FLUTE, FigLang workshop @ EMNLP 2022 (Arxiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16407) 

System 4: Two-step System - Classify then explain

In contrast to Systems 1 to 3 where the entailment/contradiction label and associated explanation are predicted jointly, System 4 uses a two-step ‚Äúclassify then explain‚Äù pipeline. This current model is for the "classify" component of the pipeline. The input-output format is:
```
Input <Premise> <Hypothesis> 
Output <Label>
```

# How to use this model?
We provide a quick example of how you can try out the "classify" component of System 4 in our paper with just a few lines of code:
```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("allenai/System4_classify_FigLang2022")

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-3b")
>>> input_string = "Premise: After releasing his rage he was like a ferocious wolf. Hypothesis: After letting off his rage he sat down like a lamb. Is there a contradiction or entailment between the premise and hypothesis? Answer : "
>>> input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_string, return_tensors="pt")
>>> output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)
['Contradiction']
```

## Training and evaluation data

We use the FLUTE dataset for the FigLang2022SharedTask (https://huggingface.co/datasets/ColumbiaNLP/FLUTE) for training this model. ‚àº7500 samples are provided as the training set. We used a 80-20 split to create our own training (6027 samples) and validation (1507 samples) partitions on which we build our models. For details on how we make use of the training data provided in the FigLang2022 shared task, please refer to https://github.com/allenai/dream/blob/main/FigLang2022SharedTask/Process_Data_Train_Dev_split.ipynb.
