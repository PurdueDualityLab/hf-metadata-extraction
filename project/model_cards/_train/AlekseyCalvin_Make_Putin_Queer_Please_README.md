### Queer Vladimir Putin Dreambooth SD Model Dreambooth model trained by A.C.T. SOON® with [Hugging Face Dreambooth Training Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/dreambooth-training) with the v1-5 model

You run your new concept via `diffusers` [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb). Don't forget to use the concept prompts! 

  
  
  
To generate custom images of a queer or/and trans alter-dimensional identities of the infamous reigning spook Vladimir Putin – use "trp" or "trp person" in your Stable Diffusion prompt during inference with this model.  
Among other crucial, yet oft neglected, documentary content available in the public sphere ("Putin finally appears in drag", "Putin plays piano in Bowie wig", "femme Putin", etc...) this model was fine-tuned on numerous distinct variants of the classic "queer Putin" meme which had once spread like wildfiring rainbows in response to the 2018 intensification of the Russian government's ruthlessly inhumane crackdowns on LGBTQ+ persons and communities .
