# CLIPSeg model 

CLIPSeg model with reduce dimension 64, refined (using a more complex convolution). It was introduced in the paper [Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) by LÃ¼ddecke et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg). 

# Intended use cases

This model is intended for zero-shot and one-shot image segmentation.
