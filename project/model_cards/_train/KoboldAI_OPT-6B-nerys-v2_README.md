# OPT 6B - Nerys
## Model Description
OPT 6B-Nerys is a finetune created using Facebook's OPT model.
## Training data
The training data contains around 2500 ebooks in various genres (the "Pike" dataset), a CYOA dataset called "CYS" and 50 Asian "Light Novels" (the "Manga-v1" dataset).
Most parts of the dataset have been prepended using the following text: `[Genre: <genre1>, <genre2>]`
This dataset has been cleaned in the same way as fairseq-dense-13B-Nerys-v2
### How to use
You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. This example generates a different sequence each time it's run:
```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline
>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='KoboldAI/OPT-6B-Nerys-v2')
>>> generator("Welcome Captain Janeway, I apologize for the delay.", do_sample=True, min_length=50)
[{'generated_text': 'Welcome Captain Janeway, I apologize for the delay."\nIt's all right," Janeway said. "I'm certain that you're doing your best to keep me informed of what\'s going on."'}]
```
### Limitations and Biases
Based on known problems with NLP technology, potential relevant factors include bias (gender, profession, race and religion).
