## TextCortex AI - Product Description Generator - Electronics Model

This is one of our legacy models that was used for generating product descriptions for Electronic products. Because of the inference times, we trained this model on a very small version of the GPT-NEO with 125M parameters.

Due to its small size, we had to train a model for each product category for our users.\
We will be releasing other trained models on other categories soon.

### How to Prompt:

Just give your product name and add 'Product Description:' at the end of it to generate product descriptions.\
Here is an example prompt:\
`Product name: USB Dongle for video capture Product Description:`

### TextCortex API
