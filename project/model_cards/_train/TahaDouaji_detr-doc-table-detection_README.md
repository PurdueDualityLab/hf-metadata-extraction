# Model Card for detr-doc-table-detection
 
# Model Details
 
detr-doc-table-detection is a model trained to detect both **Bordered** and **Borderless** tables in documents, based on [facebook/detr-resnet-50](https://huggingface.co/facebook/detr-resnet-50).

# Uses
 

## Direct Use
This model can be used for the task of object detection.
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. 
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.



## Recommendations
 
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

# Training Details
 
## Training Data
 
The model was trained on ICDAR2019 Table Dataset

 
# Environmental Impact
 
Carbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).

# How to Get Started with the Model
 
Use the code below to get started with the model.


```python
from transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

image = Image.open("IMAGE_PATH")

processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection")
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection")

inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits) to COCO API
# let's only keep detections with score > 0.9
target_sizes = torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]])
results = processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=target_sizes, threshold=0.9)[0]

for score, label, box in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"], results["boxes"]):
    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
    print(
            f"Detected {model.config.id2label[label.item()]} with confidence "
            f"{round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}"
    )
```
