# ESG Question Answering

A NLP service to identify Emission Reduction Targets and Mechanisms of various companies from their ESG disclosure or Annual Reports.

This Roberta-Base model has been finetuned on a very small sample (manually annotated). A lot of companies have clear mentions of targets & goals than methodologies which is why it can currently identify only targets & goals more precisely.
