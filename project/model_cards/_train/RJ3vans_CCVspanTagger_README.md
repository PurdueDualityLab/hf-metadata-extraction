Try the test sentence: 

<i>The woman said "my name is Sarah [and] I live in London."</i>

The model should tag the tokens in the sentence with information about whether or not they are contained within a compound clause. If you find the model useful, please cite my thesis which presents the dataset used for finetuning:

Evans, R. (2020) Sentence Simplification for Text Processing. Doctoral thesis. University of Wolverhampton. Wolverhampton, UK. (http://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/~richard/Evans2020_SentenceSimplificationForTextProcessing.pdf)

There you will find more information about the tagging scheme.

The model was derived using code adapted from an original program written by Dr. Le An Ha at the University of Wolverhampton.
