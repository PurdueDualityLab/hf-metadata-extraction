This model is a BERT based Myanmar pre-trained language model.
MyanBERTa was pre-trained for 528K steps on a word segmented Myanmar dataset consisting of 5,992,299 sentences (136M words).
As the tokenizer, byte-leve BPE tokenizer of 30,522 subword units which is learned after word segmentation is applied.
