# German RoBERTa for Sentence Embeddings V2
**The new [T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer](https://huggingface.co/T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer) model is slightly better for German language. It is also the current best model for English language and works cross-lingually. Please consider using that model.**
