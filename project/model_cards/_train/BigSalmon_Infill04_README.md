Most likely outputs (Disclaimer: I highly recommend using this over just generating):
```
prompt = """few sights are as [blank] new york city as the colorful, flashing signage of its bodegas [sep]"""
text = tokenizer.encode(prompt)
myinput, past_key_values = torch.tensor([text]), None
myinput = myinput
myinput= myinput.to(device)
logits, past_key_values = model(myinput, past_key_values = past_key_values, return_dict=False)
logits = logits[0,-1]
probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(logits)
best_logits, best_indices = logits.topk(250)
best_words = [tokenizer.decode([idx.item()]) for idx in best_indices]
text.append(best_indices[0].item())
best_probabilities = probabilities[best_indices].tolist()
words = []   
print(best_words)
