# CodeParrot ðŸ¦œ (small)

CodeParrot ðŸ¦œ is a GPT-2 model (110M parameters) trained to generate Python code.

## Usage

You can load the CodeParrot model and tokenizer directly in `transformers`:

```Python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead
  
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("lvwerra/codeparrot-small")
model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("lvwerra/codeparrot-small")

inputs = tokenizer("def hello_world():", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
```

or with a `pipeline`:

```Python
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="lvwerra/codeparrot-small")
outputs = pipe("def hello_world():")
```

## Training

The model was trained on the cleaned [CodeParrot ðŸ¦œ dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lvwerra/codeparrot-clean) with the following settings:

|Config|Value|
|-------|-----|
|Batch size| 192 |
|Context size| 1024 |
|Training steps| 150'000|
|Gradient accumulation| 1|
|Gradient checkpointing| False|
|Learning rate| 5e-4 |
|Weight decay | 0.1 |
|Warmup steps| 2000 |
|Schedule| Cosine |

The training was executed on 16 x A100 (40GB) GPUs. This setting amounts to roughly 29 billion tokens.

## Performance

We evaluated the model on OpenAI's [HumanEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai_humaneval) benchmark which consists of programming challenges:

| Metric | Value |
|-------|-----|
|pass@1 | 3.80% |
|pass@10 | 6.57%	 |
|pass@100 | 12.78% |

The [pass@k metric](https://huggingface.co/metrics/code_eval) tells the probability that at least one out of k generations passes the tests.
