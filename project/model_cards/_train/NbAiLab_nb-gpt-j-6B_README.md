# NB-GPT-J-6B

## Demo: https://ai.nb.no/demo/nb-gpt-j-6B/ (Be patient, it runs on CPU ðŸ˜…)

## Model Description

NB-GPT-J-6B is a Norwegian finetuned version of GPT-J 6B, a transformer model trained using Ben Wang's [Mesh Transformer JAX](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/). "GPT-J" refers to the class of model, while "6B" represents the number of trainable parameters (6 billion parameters).

The model consists of 28 layers with a model dimension of 4096, and a feedforward dimension of 16384. The model
dimension is split into 16 heads, each with a dimension of 256. Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is applied to 64
dimensions of each head. The model is trained with a tokenization vocabulary of 50257, using the same set of BPEs as
GPT-2/GPT-3.

## Training data

NB-GPT-J-6B was finetuned on [NCC](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NbAiLab/NCC), the Norwegian Colossal Corpus, plus other Internet sources like Wikipedia, mC4, and OSCAR.

## Training procedure

This model was finetuned for 130 billion tokens over 1,000,000 steps on a TPU v3-8 VM. It was trained as an autoregressive language model, using cross-entropy loss to maximize the likelihood of predicting the next token correctly.

## Intended Use and Limitations

NB-GPT-J-6B learns an inner representation of the Norwegian language that can be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating text from a prompt.

### How to use

This model can be easily loaded using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` functionality:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("NbAiLab/nb-gpt-j-6B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("NbAiLab/nb-gpt-j-6B")
```

### Limitations and Biases

As the original GPT-J model, the core functionality of NB-GPT-J-6B is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work. When prompting NB-GPT-J-6B it is important to remember that the statistically most likely next token is often not the token that produces the most "accurate" text. Never depend upon NB-GPT-J-6B to produce factually accurate output.

The original GPT-J was trained on the Pile, a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. Depending upon use case GPT-J may produce socially unacceptable text. See [Sections 5 and 6 of the Pile paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027) for a more detailed analysis of the biases in the Pile. A fine-grained analysis of the bias contained in the corpus used for fine-tuning is still pending.

As with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how NB-GPT-J-6B will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results.

## Evaluation results

We still have to find proper datasets to evaluate the model, so help is welcome!
