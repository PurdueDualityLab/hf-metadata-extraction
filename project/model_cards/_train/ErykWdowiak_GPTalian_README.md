# GPTalian

This is a GPT2 model of Italian regional languages trained on [collections of Italian "dialect poetry"](http://dialectpoetry.com) by Luigi Bonaffini.

This is a multilingual model.  Italians use the word "dialect" to describe their regional languages, but they are separate languages.  And there's a lot of English in this dataset too.

The challenge of this project is to train a model to write the languages of Italy.

For those who do not know Italian, here's some (lowercase) text that you can type into the API box:

- oggi si parla il dialetto
- la sua poesia viene di
- ma non sempre trova
