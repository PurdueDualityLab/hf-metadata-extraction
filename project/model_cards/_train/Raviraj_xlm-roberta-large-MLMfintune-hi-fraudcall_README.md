This model is finetuned for masked language modeling.

I have used xlm-roberta-large model for pretraining over half a million tokens of

Hindi fraud call transcripts. 

You can import this model with pretrained() method from the transformer library.

please note this works well on general Hindi but it's result on native language dialogues are enhanced 

in comparison to general libraries.
