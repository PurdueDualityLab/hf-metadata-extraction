This is a BART-large model finetuned on roughly 58000 aligned sentence pairs in English and Middle English, collected from the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, John Wycliffe, and the Gawain Poet.
<br>
It includes special characters such as Ã¾. 
<br>
This model reflects the spelling inconsistencies characteristic of Middle English.
<br>
Because the model is trained largely on poetry and some prose, it is best at translating those sorts of tasks.
<br>
Performance can be improved by sentence tokenizing input data and translating sentence-by-sentence.
<br>
Removing contractions (hadn't -> had not) also boosts performance.
