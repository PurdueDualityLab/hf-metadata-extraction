# CAMeLBERT: A collection of pre-trained models for Arabic NLP tasks

## Model description

**CAMeLBERT** is a collection of BERT models pre-trained on Arabic texts with different sizes and variants.
We release pre-trained language models for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic (DA), and classical Arabic (CA), in addition to a model pre-trained on a mix of the three.
We also provide additional models that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant (half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth).
The details are described in the paper *"[The Interplay of Variant, Size, and Task Type in Arabic Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06678)."*

This model card describes **CAMeLBERT-MSA-sixteenth** (`bert-base-arabic-camelbert-msa-sixteenth`), a model pre-trained on a sixteenth of the full MSA dataset.

## Intended uses
You can use the released model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction.
However, it is mostly intended to be fine-tuned on an NLP task, such as NER, POS tagging, sentiment analysis, dialect identification, and poetry classification.
We release our fine-tuninig code [here](https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/CAMeLBERT).

#### How to use
You can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:
```python
>>> from transformers import pipeline
>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-msa-sixteenth')
>>> unmasker("الهدف من الحياة هو [MASK] .")
[{'sequence': '[CLS] الهدف من الحياة هو التغيير. [SEP]',
  'score': 0.08320745080709457,
  'token': 7946,
  'token_str': 'التغيير'},
 {'sequence': '[CLS] الهدف من الحياة هو التعلم. [SEP]',
  'score': 0.04305094853043556,
  'token': 12554,
  'token_str': 'التعلم'},
 {'sequence': '[CLS] الهدف من الحياة هو العمل. [SEP]',
  'score': 0.0417640283703804,
  'token': 2854,
  'token_str': 'العمل'},
 {'sequence': '[CLS] الهدف من الحياة هو الحياة. [SEP]',
  'score': 0.041371218860149384,
  'token': 3696,
  'token_str': 'الحياة'},
 {'sequence': '[CLS] الهدف من الحياة هو المعرفة. [SEP]',
  'score': 0.039794355630874634,
  'token': 7344,
  'token_str': 'المعرفة'}]
```

*Note*: to download our models, you would need `transformers>=3.5.0`. Otherwise, you could download the models manually.

Here is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-msa-sixteenth')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-msa-sixteenth')
text = "مرحبا يا عالم."
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
output = model(**encoded_input)
```

and in TensorFlow:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-msa-sixteenth')
model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained('CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-msa-sixteenth')
text = "مرحبا يا عالم."
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')
output = model(encoded_input)
```

## Training data
- MSA (Modern Standard Arabic)
  - [The Arabic Gigaword Fifth Edition](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T11)
  - [Abu El-Khair Corpus](http://www.abuelkhair.net/index.php/en/arabic/abu-el-khair-corpus)
  - [OSIAN corpus](https://vlo.clarin.eu/search;jsessionid=31066390B2C9E8C6304845BA79869AC1?1&q=osian)
  - [Arabic Wikipedia](https://archive.org/details/arwiki-20190201)
  - The unshuffled version of the Arabic [OSCAR corpus](https://oscar-corpus.com/)

## Training procedure
We use [the original implementation](https://github.com/google-research/bert) released by Google for pre-training.
We follow the original English BERT model's hyperparameters for pre-training, unless otherwise specified.

### Preprocessing
- After extracting the raw text from each corpus, we apply the following pre-processing.
- We first remove invalid characters and normalize white spaces using the utilities provided by [the original BERT implementation](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/eedf5716ce1268e56f0a50264a88cafad334ac61/tokenization.py#L286-L297).
- We also remove lines without any Arabic characters.
- We then remove diacritics and kashida using [CAMeL Tools](https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/camel_tools).
- Finally, we split each line into sentences with a heuristics-based sentence segmenter.
- We train a WordPiece tokenizer on the entire dataset (167 GB text) with a vocabulary size of 30,000 using [HuggingFace's tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers).
- We do not lowercase letters nor strip accents.

### Pre-training
- The model was trained on a single cloud TPU (`v3-8`) for one million steps in total.
- The first 90,000 steps were trained with a batch size of 1,024 and the rest was trained with a batch size of 256.
- The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens for 90% of the steps and 512 for the remaining 10%.
- We use whole word masking and a duplicate factor of 10.
- We set max predictions per sequence to 20 for the dataset with max sequence length of 128 tokens and 80 for the dataset with max sequence length of 512 tokens.
- We use a random seed of 12345, masked language model probability of 0.15, and short sequence probability of 0.1.
- The optimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 1e-4, \\(\beta_{1} = 0.9\\) and \\(\beta_{2} = 0.999\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 10,000 steps and linear decay of the learning rate after.

## Evaluation results
- We evaluate our pre-trained language models on five NLP tasks: NER, POS tagging, sentiment analysis, dialect identification, and poetry classification.
- We fine-tune and evaluate the models using 12 dataset.
- We used Hugging Face's transformers to fine-tune our CAMeLBERT models.
- We used transformers `v3.1.0` along with PyTorch `v1.5.1`.
- The fine-tuning was done by adding a fully connected linear layer to the last hidden state.
- We use \\(F_{1}\\) score as a metric for all tasks.
- Code used for fine-tuning is available [here](https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/CAMeLBERT).

To do so, we build three pre-trained language models across three variants of Arabic: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal Arabic, and classical Arabic, in addition to a fourth language model which is pre-trained on a mix of the three. We also examine the importance of pre-training data size by building additional models that are pre-trained on a scaled-down set of the MSA variant. We compare our different models to each other, as well as to eight publicly available models by fine-tuning them on five NLP tasks spanning 12 datasets. Our results suggest that the variant proximity of pre-training data to fine-tuning data is more important than the pre-training data size. We exploit this insight in defining an optimized system selection model for the studied tasks.",
