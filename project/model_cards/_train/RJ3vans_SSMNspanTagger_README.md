This model identifies complex NPs modified by non-finite nominal clauses ("appositives") in the input sentence.

Try the test sentence:

My name is Sarah and I live in London[,] the capital of England.

Note that accuracy is greatly improved if you place square brackets around the left boundary of the non-finite nominal clause.

The model was derived using code adapted from an original program written by Dr. Le An Ha at the University of Wolverhampton.
