The source code to train this model is available on the  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/soduco/paper-ner-bench-das22) of the paper as a Jupyter notebook in  `src/ner/40_experiment_2.ipynb`.


## Model description
This model adapts the model [Jean-Baptiste/camembert-ner](https://huggingface.co/Jean-Baptiste/camembert-ner) for NER on 6004 manually annotated directory entries referred as the "reference dataset" in the paper.

Trade directory entries are short and strongly structured texts that giving the name, activity and location of a person or business, e.g: 
```

```

## Intended uses & limitations
This model is intended for reproducibility of the NER evaluation published in the DAS2022 paper.
Several derived models trained for NER on trade directories are available on HuggingFace, each trained on a different dataset :
- [das22-10-camembert_pretrained_finetuned_ref](): trained for NER on ~6000 directory entries manually corrected.
- [das22-10-camembert_pretrained_finetuned_pero](): trained for NER on ~6000 directory entries extracted with PERO-OCR.
- [das22-10-camembert_pretrained_finetuned_tess](): trained for NER on ~6000 directory entries extracted with Tesseract.
