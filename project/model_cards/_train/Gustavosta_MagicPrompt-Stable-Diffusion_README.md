# MagicPrompt - Stable Diffusion

This is a model from the MagicPrompt series of models, which are [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) models intended to generate prompt texts for imaging AIs, in this case: [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion).

## üñºÔ∏è Here's an example:

This model was trained with 150,000 steps and a set of about 80,000 data filtered and extracted from the image finder for Stable Diffusion: "[Lexica.art](https://lexica.art/)". It was a little difficult to extract the data, since the search engine still doesn't have a public API without being protected by cloudflare, but if you want to take a look at the original dataset, you can have a look here: [datasets/Gustavosta/Stable-Diffusion-Prompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gustavosta/Stable-Diffusion-Prompts).

If you want to test the model with a demo, you can go to: "[spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion)".
