Abstract: Recent work on self-supervised pre-training focus</b> on leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech data to build robust end-to-end (E2E)acoustic models (AM) that can be later fine-tuned on downstream tasks e.g., automatic speech recognition (ASR). Yet, few works investigated the impact on performance when the data properties substantially differ between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases, termed domain shift. We target this scenario by analyzing the robustness of Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R models on downstream ASR for a completely unseen domain, air traffic control (ATC) communications. We benchmark these two models on several open-source and challenging ATC databases with signal-to-noise ratio between 5 and 20 dB. Relative word error rate (WER) reductions between 20% to 40% are obtained in comparison to hybrid-based ASR baselines by only fine-tuning E2E acoustic models with a smaller fraction of labeled data. We analyze WERs on the low-resource scenario and gender bias carried by one ATC dataset.

## Usage

You can use our Google Colab notebook to run and evaluate our model: https://github.com/idiap/w2v2-air-traffic/blob/master/src/eval_xlsr_atc_model.ipynb

## Intended uses & limitations

This model was fine-tuned on air traffic control data. We don't expect that it keeps the same performance on some others datasets, e.g., LibriSpeech or CommonVoice.


## Training and evaluation data

See Table 1 (page 3) in our paper: [How Does Pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 Perform on Domain Shifted ASR? An Extensive Benchmark on Air Traffic Control Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16822). We described there the partitions of how to use our model. 

- We use the UWB-ATCC corpus to fine-tune this model. You can download the raw data here: https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0001-CCA1-0
- However, do not worry, we have prepared the database in `Datasets format`. Here, [UWB-ATCC corpus on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jzuluaga/uwb_atcc). You can scroll and check the train/test partitions, and even listen to some audios.
- If you want to prepare a database in HuggingFace format, you can follow the data loader script in: [data_loader_atc.py](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jzuluaga/uwb_atcc/blob/main/atc_data_loader.py).

## Writing your own inference script

If you use language model, you need to install the KenLM bindings with:

```bash
conda activate your_environment
pip install https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/archive/master.zip
```

The snippet of code:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric, Audio
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor, Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM
import torchaudio.functional as F

USE_LM = False
DATASET_ID = "Jzuluaga/uwb_atcc"
MODEL_ID = "Jzuluaga/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self-en-atc-uwb-atcc"

# 1. Load the dataset
# we only load the 'test' partition, however, if you want to load the 'train' partition, you can change it accordingly
uwb_atcc_corpus_test = load_dataset(DATASET_ID, "test", split="test")

# 2. Load the model
model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)

# 3. Load the processors, we offer support with LM, which should yield better resutls
if USE_LM:
    processor = Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)
else:
    processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)
# 4. Format the test sample
sample = next(iter(uwb_atcc_corpus_test))
file_sampling_rate = sample['audio']['sampling_rate']
# resample if neccessary
if file_sampling_rate != 16000:
    resampled_audio = F.resample(torch.tensor(sample["audio"]["array"]), file_sampling_rate, 16000).numpy()
else:
    resampled_audio = torch.tensor(sample["audio"]["array"]).numpy()
input_values = processor(resampled_audio, return_tensors="pt").input_values

# 5. Run the forward pass in the model
with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(input_values).logits
    
# get the transcription with processor
if USE_LM:
    transcription = processor.batch_decode(logits.numpy()).text
else:
    pred_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)
    transcription = processor.batch_decode(pred_ids)
# print the output
print(transcription)
```
