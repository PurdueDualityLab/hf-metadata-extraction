# Cedille AI
Cedille is a project to bring large language models to non-English languages.

## fr-boris
Boris is a 6B parameter autoregressive language model based on the GPT-J architecture and trained using the [mesh-transformer-jax](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax) codebase.

Boris was trained on around 78B tokens of French text from the [C4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4) dataset. We started training from GPT-J, which has been trained on [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/). As a consequence the model still has good performance in English language. Boris makes use of the unmodified GPT-2 tokenizer.

Boris is named after the great French writer [Boris Vian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vian).

# How do I test Cedille?
For the time being, the easiest way to test the model is to use our [publicly accessible playground](https://en.cedille.ai/).

Cedille is a relatively large model and running it in production can get expensive. Consider contacting us for API access at hello@cedille.ai.
