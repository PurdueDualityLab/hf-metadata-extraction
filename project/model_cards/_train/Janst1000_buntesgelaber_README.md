## How this model was trained
This model was trained on https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze. I wrote a simple script that takes all of the text inside of the repository and puts it all into a single text file. Then I trained the model using the HuggingFace tutorial https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train
