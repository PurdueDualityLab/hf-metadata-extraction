# Regression Model for Energy Levels (ICF b1300)

## Description
A fine-tuned regression model that assigns a functioning level to Dutch sentences describing energy level. The model is based on a pre-trained Dutch medical language model ([link to be added]()): a RoBERTa model, trained from scratch on clinical notes of the Amsterdam UMC. To detect sentences about energy level in clinical text in Dutch, use the [icf-domains](https://huggingface.co/CLTL/icf-domains) classification model.

## Functioning levels
Level | Meaning
---|---
4 | No problem with the energy level.
3 | Slight fatigue that causes mild limitations.
2 | Moderate fatigue; the patient gets easily tired from light activities or needs a long time to recover after an activity.
1 | Severe fatigue; the patient is capable of very little.
0 | Very severe fatigue; unable to do anything and mostly lays in bed.

The predictions generated by the model might sometimes be outside of the scale (e.g. 4.2); this is normal in a regression model.

## Intended uses and limitations
- The model was fine-tuned (trained, validated and tested) on medical records from the Amsterdam UMC (the two academic medical centers of Amsterdam). It might perform differently on text from a different hospital or text from non-hospital sources (e.g. GP records).
- The model was fine-tuned with the [Simple Transformers](https://simpletransformers.ai/) library. This library is based on Transformers but the model cannot be used directly with Transformers `pipeline` and classes; doing so would generate incorrect outputs. For this reason, the API on this page is disabled.

## How to use
To generate predictions with the model, use the [Simple Transformers](https://simpletransformers.ai/) library:
```
from simpletransformers.classification import ClassificationModel

model = ClassificationModel(
    'roberta',
    'CLTL/icf-levels-enr',
    use_cuda=False,
)

example = 'Al jaren extreme vermoeidheid overdag, valt overdag in slaap tijdens school- en werkactiviteiten en soms zelfs tijdens een gesprek.'
_, raw_outputs = model.predict([example])
predictions = np.squeeze(raw_outputs)
```
The prediction on the example is:
```
1.98
```
The raw outputs look like this:
```
[[1.97520316]]
```

## Training data
- The training data consists of clinical notes from medical records (in Dutch) of the Amsterdam UMC. Due to privacy constraints, the data cannot be released.
- The annotation guidelines used for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/cltl/a-proof-zonmw/tree/main/resources/annotation_guidelines).

## Training procedure
The default training parameters of Simple Transformers were used, including:
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Learning rate: 4e-5
- Num train epochs: 1
- Train batch size: 8

## Evaluation results
The evaluation is done on a sentence-level (the classification unit) and on a note-level (the aggregated unit which is meaningful for the healthcare professionals).

| | Sentence-level | Note-level
|---|---|---
mean absolute error | 0.48 | 0.43
mean squared error | 0.49 | 0.42
root mean squared error | 0.70 | 0.65
