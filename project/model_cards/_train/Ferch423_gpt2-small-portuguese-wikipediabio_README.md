# GPT2-SMALL-PORTUGUESE-WIKIPEDIABIO


This is a finetuned model version of gpt2-small-portuguese(https://huggingface.co/pierreguillou/gpt2-small-portuguese) by pierreguillou.

It was trained on a person abstract dataset extracted from DBPEDIA (over 100000 people's abstracts). The model is intended as a simple and fun experiment for generating texts abstracts based on ordinary people's names.
