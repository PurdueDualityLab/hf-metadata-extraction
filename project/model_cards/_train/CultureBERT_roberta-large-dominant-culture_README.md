This model is a fine-tuned version of RoBERTa-large [1]. It was trained on 1,400 employee reviews to measure corporate culture. More specifically, it predicts which of the four culture dimensions of the Competing Values Framework [2,3] best fits the text at hands, i.e., what is the **dominant culture**.

The model assigns one of four possible labels:

0 (**clan**): Text is best described by a **clan (collaborating) culture**. <br />
1 (**adhocracy**): Text is best described by an **adhocracy (creating) culture**.<br />
2 (**market**): Text is best described by a **market (competing) culture**.<br />
3 (**hierarchy**): Text is best described by a **hierarchy (controlling) culture**.<br />
