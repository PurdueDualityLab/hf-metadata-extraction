# Named Entity Recognition model for swedish
This model is a fine-tuned version of [KBLab/bert-base-swedish-cased-ner](https://huggingface.co/KBLab/bert-base-swedish-cased-ner)for only Swedish. It has been fine-tuned on the concatenation of a smaller version of SUC 3.0 and some medical text from the Swedish website 1177.

The model will predict the following entities:

| Tag | Name | Exampel |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|
| PER	        |Person   | (e.g.,  Johan  and  Sofia)   |
| LOC        | Location  | (e.g., GÃ¶teborg and Spanien)   | 
| ORG        | Organisation   | (e.g., Volvo and Skatteverket) \  | 
| PHARMA_DRUGS        | Medication  |  (e.g., Paracetamol and Omeprazol)|
| HEALTH        | Illness/Diseases  | (e.g., Cancer, sjuk and diabetes)  | 
| Relation        | Family members  |  (e.g., Mamma and Farmor)  |
