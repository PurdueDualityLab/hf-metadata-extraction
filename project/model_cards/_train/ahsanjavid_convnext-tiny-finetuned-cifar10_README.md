# ConvNext-tiny-finetuned-cifar10 (tiny-sized model) 

ConvNeXT model trained on ImageNet-1k at resolution 224x224. It was introduced in the paper [A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) by Liu et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt).
Convnext tiny finetuned on cifar 10 dataset. Which has ten classes.

Disclaimer: The team releasing ConvNeXT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.
