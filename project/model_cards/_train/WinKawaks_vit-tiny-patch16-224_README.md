Google didn't publish vit-tiny and vit-small model checkpoints in Hugging Face. I converted the weights from the [timm repository](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models). This model is used in the same way as [ViT-base](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224).

Note that [safetensors] model requires torch 2.0 environment.
