# first

This model is a fine-tuned version of [longformer-gottbert-base-8192-aw512-](https://huggingface.co/longformer-8192-aw512-gottbert-base) on the a 500 million token subset of the german parts of the OSCAR dataset.
It achieves the following results on the custom evaluation set:
- Loss: 1.4981

## Model description

The weights of the model are initialized from the german version of Roberta [gottbert-base](https://huggingface.co/uklfr/gottbert-base).
The local attention windows have a fixed size of 512 tokens across all layers.
The maximum sequence length is 8192.

## Intended uses & limitations

Longformer models enable processing long texts using a mixture of local attention on each subword token and task specific global attention on a subset of the tokens.

## Training and evaluation data

The [OSCAR](https://oscar-corpus.com) dataset is freely avaible corpus of filtered web texts from the Common Crawl in various languages. We used the 2017 version of the dataset. 

## Training procedure
The model was trained with masked language modeling for 3 epochs on a customly created 500Â million tokens subset of the german proportion of the [OSCAR](https://oscar-corpus.com) dataset.
It was validated using 5% of the original subset.
