# Stable Diffusion fine tuned on art by [Cinga Samson](https://whitecube.com/artists/artist/cinga_samson)

### Usage
Use by adding the keyword "cingasamson" to the prompt. The model was trained with the "man" classname, which can also be added to the prompt.

## Samples
The top 2 samples are "pure" while others are mixed with other artists and modifiers. I hope it still gives you an idea of what kind of 
styles can be created with this model.

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).
