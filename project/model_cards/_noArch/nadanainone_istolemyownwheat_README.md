Same dataset as istolemyownart (https://huggingface.co/nadanainone/istolemyownart) with 9 extra drawings I had around not uploaded on Tumblr. Based on Anything instead of a personal merge, also using some tweaked settings with the latest updated Dreambooth extension for Voldy's (AUTOMATIC1111)'s UI. Produces less random overdetailed backgrounds and focuses more on characters which might be a better/worse thing. 

Trained at 15k steps instead of 10k, files included are 5k, 10k and 15k steps. 5k steps produces more aesthetic results since my style isn't fully baked in, 10k is a middle point, 15k is why you should never draw like me.

Prompt is still ludditesbtfo

Same terms from istolemyownart apply, you can wrangle it with better artists to improve results. 

Examples:

Additional heavily cherry picked random examples at random steps because I'm too lazy to sort them:

Tested for bad pickles, bad pickle free

>can I add bad pickles to incriminate you and win over gross AI chuds? 

imagine being this much of a redditor

>Does this give me and everyone else the rights over your entire art and dataset and all your future artworks both made manually and with AI?

lol no still

>Can I use anything generated with this model for whatever I want though?

Still can't stop fair use and derivative works

>Can I sell your model?

No, all models should always be free and open source. Always.

>Can I train another model using your art?

Sure, it'll probably be better than both my attempts. 

>Do I own that model if I make it?

Nope, still lol no

>Can I use this to impersonate you and make bad faith arguments to make MY stunning and brave anti AI argument win over your disgusting pro AI argument, chud?

lmao even

>Well your still art sucks!
