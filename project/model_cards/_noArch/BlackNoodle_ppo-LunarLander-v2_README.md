# **PPO** Agent playing **LunarLander-v2**
This is a trained model of a **PPO** agent playing **LunarLander-v2**
using the [stable-baselines3 library](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

## Usage (with Stable-baselines3)
TODO: Add your code


```python
from huggingface_sb3 import load_from_hub
repo_id = "BlackNoodle/ppo-LunarLander-v2" # The repo_id
filename = "ppo-LunarLander-v2.zip" # The model filename.zip

# When the model was trained on Python 3.8 the pickle protocol is 5
# But Python 3.6, 3.7 use protocol 4
# In order to get compatibility we need to:
# 1. Install pickle5 (we done it at the beginning of the colab)
# 2. Create a custom empty object we pass as parameter to PPO.load()
custom_objects = {
            "learning_rate": 0.0,
            "lr_schedule": lambda _: 0.0,
            "clip_range": lambda _: 0.0,
}

checkpoint = load_from_hub(repo_id, filename)
model = PPO.load(checkpoint, custom_objects=custom_objects, print_system_info=True)

```
