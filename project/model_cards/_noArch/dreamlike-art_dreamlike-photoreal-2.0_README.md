# Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0 is a photorealistic model based on Stable Diffusion 1.5, made by [dreamlike.art](https://dreamlike.art/).  
  
# If you want to use dreamlike models on your website/app/etc., check the license at the bottom first!  

Warning: This model is horny! Add "nude, naked" to the negative prompt if want to avoid NSFW.  
  
You can add **photo** to your prompt to make your gens look more photorealistic.   
Non-square aspect ratios work better for some prompts. If you want a portrait photo, try using a vertical aspect ratio. If you want a landscape photo, try using a horizontal aspect ratio.  
This model was trained on 768x768px images, so use 768x768px, 640x896px, 896x640px, etc. It also works pretty good with higher resolutions such as 768x1024px or 1024x768px.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "photo, a church in the middle of a field of crops, bright cinematic lighting, gopro, fisheye lens"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./result.jpg")
```
