# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to [Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion). Conversion instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-or-safetensors-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
  - `original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.<br>
  
# Note: Some models do not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).
