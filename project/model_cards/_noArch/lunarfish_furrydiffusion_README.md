FurryDiffusion is a model made to generate furry art, this model is very much in beta still and will keep improoving! To use this please make sure to include `furry` in your prompt and to make a specific breed add the breed name only.

Example Prompts:
```
Positive: highres, furry, fox, orange fur, blue eyes
Negative: lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, blurry
```


Test the concept via A1111 Colab [fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)
Or you can run your new concept via `diffusers` [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb)

**NOTE**: Its better to run it in Google Colab since you can use google's powerful gpu's for free. Go ahead try it now!
