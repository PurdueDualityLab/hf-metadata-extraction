# ACertainty

ACertainty is a carefully designed model that is well-suited for further fine-tuning and training for use in dreambooth. It is easier to train than other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, and is less biased and more balanced for further development. This model is less likely to be biased by laion-aesthetic preferences, brought by Stable-Diffusion-v1-4+.

This is not the base of ACertainModel, but you can use this model as your new base to train your new dreambooth model about a couple themes or charactors or styles.

e.g. **_masterpiece, best quality, 1girl, brown hair, green eyes, colorful, autumn, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, blue sky, falling leaves, garden_** 

## About online preview with Hosted inference API, also generation with this model

Parameters are not allowed to be modified, as it seems that it is generated with *Clip skip: 1*, for better performance, it is strongly recommended to use *Clip skip: 2* instead.

Here is an example of inference settings, if it is applicable with you on your own server: *Steps: 28, Sampler: Euler a, CFG scale: 11, Clip skip: 2*.

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or FLAX/JAX.

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "JosephusCheung/ACertainty"
branch_name= "main"

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, revision=branch_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "pikachu"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./pikachu.png")
```
