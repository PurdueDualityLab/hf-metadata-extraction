# SepFormer trained on WHAMR! for speech enhancement (8k sampling frequency)
This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform speech enhancement (denoising + dereverberation) with a [SepFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154v2) model, implemented with SpeechBrain, and pretrained on [WHAMR!](http://wham.whisper.ai/) dataset with 8k sampling frequency, which is basically a version of WSJ0-Mix dataset with environmental noise and reverberation in 8k. For a better experience we encourage you to learn more about [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The given model performance is 10.59 dB SI-SNR on the test set of WHAMR! dataset.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform speech enhancement on your own audio file

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import SepformerSeparation as separator
import torchaudio

model = separator.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/sepformer-whamr-enhancement", savedir='pretrained_models/sepformer-whamr-enhancement')

# for custom file, change path
est_sources = model.separate_file(path='speechbrain/sepformer-whamr-enhancement/example_whamr.wav') 

torchaudio.save("enhanced_whamr.wav", est_sources[:, :, 0].detach().cpu(), 8000)

```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The training script is currently being worked on an ongoing pull-request. 

We will update the model card as soon as the PR is merged. 

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V0KwkEfWwomZ0Vjox0BTnQ694_uxgu8G).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
