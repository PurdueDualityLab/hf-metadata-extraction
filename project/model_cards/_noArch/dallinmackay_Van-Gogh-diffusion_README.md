### Van Gogh Diffusion

v2 - fixed and working

This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (based on v1.5) trained on screenshots from the film **_Loving Vincent_**. Use the token **_lvngvncnt_** at the BEGINNING of your prompts to use the style (e.g., "lvngvncnt, beautiful woman at sunset"). This model works best with the Euler sampler (NOT Euler_a).

_Download the ckpt file from "files and versions" tab into the stable diffusion models folder of your web-ui of choice._

If you get too many yellow faces or you dont like the strong blue bias, simply put them in the negative prompt (e.g., "Yellow face, blue").

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "dallinmackay/Van-Gogh-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "lvngvncnt, beautiful woman at sunset"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./sunset.png")
```
