# Core ML Converted Model

This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices by following Apple's instructions [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).<br>
Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>

`split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
`original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.

Unfortunately, for this model the `split_einsum` version did not generate images correctly and was removed.

# Dreamlike Diffusion 1.0 is SD 1.5 fine tuned on high quality art, made by [dreamlike.art](https://dreamlike.art/).

Use the same prompts as you would for SD 1.5. Add **dreamlikeart** if the artstyle is too weak.    
Non-square aspect ratios work better for some prompts. If you want a portrait photo, try using a 2:3 or a 9:16 aspect ratio. If you want a landscape photo, try using a 3:2 or a 16:9 aspect ratio.  
Use slightly higher resolution for better results: 640x640px, 512x768px, 768x512px, etc.

### Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run dreamlike-diffusion-1.0:

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "dreamlikeart, a grungy woman with rainbow hair, travelling between dimensions, dynamic pose, happy, soft eyes and narrow chin, extreme bokeh, dainty figure, long hair straight down, torn kawaii shirt and baggy jeans, In style of by Jordan Grimmer and greg rutkowski, crisp lines and color, complex background, particles, lines, wind, concept art, sharp focus, vivid colors"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./result.jpg")
```
