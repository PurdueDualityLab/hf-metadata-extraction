### Archer Diffusion

This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on screenshots from the TV-show Archer.
Use the tokens **_archer style_** in your prompts for the effect.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
#!pip install diffusers transformers scipy torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "nitrosocke/archer-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a magical princess with golden hair, archer style"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./magical_princess.png")
```

#### Prompt and settings for portraits:
**archer style beautiful portrait of ariana grande**
_Steps: 20, Sampler: Euler a, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 946707299, Size: 512x704_
#### Prompt and settings for landscapes:
**archer style suburban street night blue indoor lighting Negative prompt: grey cars**
_Steps: 20, Sampler: Euler a, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 2915669764, Size: 1024x576_

This model was trained using the diffusers based dreambooth training and prior-preservation loss in 4.000 steps and using the _train-text-encoder_ feature.
