# Ukeiyo-style Diffusion

This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on traditional Japanese Ukeiyo-style images.
Use the tokens  **_ukeiyoddim style_**  in your prompts for the effect.
The model repo also contains a ckpt file , so that you can use the model with your own implementation of 
stable diffusion.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
#!pip install diffusers transformers scipy torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
model_id = "salmonhumorous/ukeiyo-style-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
prompt = "illustration of ukeiyoddim style landscape"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("./ukeiyo_landscape.png")
```

## Training procedure and data

The training for this model was done using a RTX 3090. The training was completed in 28 minutes for a total of 2000 steps. A total of 33 instance images (Images of the style I was aiming for) and 1k Regularization images was used. Regularization images dataset used by [ProGamerGov](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ProGamerGov/StableDiffusion-v1-5-Regularization-Images).
