# BPModel

![BPModel](images/BPModel.png)

## Update

**2023-01-02:** I wasted more GPU hours to train it a little bit more overfitting. Check out [bp_mk3.safetensors](bp_mk3.safetensors) and [bp_mk5.safetensors](bp_mk5.safetensors). Prepare yourself own VAE! Update your WebUI if you can't load [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors). Adds lots of samples in `images` folder!

**2023-01-06:** Checkout [NMFSAN](NMFSAN/README.md) for a new model trained with custom embeddings.

## Introduction

![car](images/00976-3769766671_20221226155509.png)

BPModel is an experimental Stable Diffusion model based on [ACertainty](https://huggingface.co/JosephusCheung/ACertainty) from [Joseph Cheung](https://huggingface.co/JosephusCheung). 

Why is the Model even existing? There are loads of Stable Diffusion model out there, especially anime style models.
Well, is there any models trained with resolution base resolution (`base_res`) 768 even 1024 before? Don't think so.
Here it is, the BPModel, a Stable Diffusion model you may love or hate.
Trained with 5k high quality images that suit my taste (not necessary yours unfortunately) from [Sankaku Complex](https://chan.sankakucomplex.com) with annotations. 
The dataset is public in [Crosstyan/BPDataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Crosstyan/BPDataset) for the sake of full disclosure .
Pure combination of tags may not be the optimal way to describe the image, 
but I don't need to do extra work. 
And no, I won't feed any AI generated image
to the model even it might outlaw the model from being used in some countries.

The training of a high resolution model requires a significant amount of GPU
hours and can be costly. In this particular case, 10 V100 GPU hours were spent
on training 30 epochs with a resolution of 512, while 60 V100 GPU hours were spent
on training 30 epochs with a resolution of 768. An additional 100 V100 GPU hours
were also spent on training a model with a resolution of 1024, although **ONLY** 10
epochs were run. The results of the training on the 1024 resolution model did
not show a significant improvement compared to the 768 resolution model, and the
resource demands, achieving a batch size of 1 on a V100 with 32G VRAM, were
high. However, training on the 768 resolution did yield better results than
training on the 512 resolution, and it is worth considering as an option. It is
worth noting that Stable Diffusion 2.x also chose to train on a 768 resolution
model. However, it may be more efficient to start with training on a 512
resolution model due to the slower training process and the need for additional
prior knowledge to speed up the training process when working with a 768
resolution.

[Mikubill/naifu-diffusion](https://github.com/Mikubill/naifu-diffusion) is used as training script and I also recommend to
checkout [CCRcmcpe/scal-sdt](https://github.com/CCRcmcpe/scal-sdt).

The configuration for 1024 and 768 resolution with aspect ratio bucket is presented here. 

```yaml
# 768
arb:
  enabled: true
  debug: false
  base_res: [768, 768]
  max_size: [1152, 768]
  divisible: 64
  max_ar_error: 4
  min_dim: 512
  dim_limit: 1792

# 1024
arb:
  enabled: true
  debug: false
  base_res: [1024, 1024]
  max_size: [1536, 1024]
  divisible: 64
  max_ar_error: 4
  min_dim: 960
  dim_limit: 2389
```

## Limitation

![building](images/00167-4082916932_20230102081230.png)

The limitation described in [SCAL-SDT Wiki](https://github.com/CCRcmcpe/scal-sdt/wiki#what-you-should-expect)
is still applied.

> SD cannot generate human body properly, like generating 6 fingers on one hand. 

BPModel can generate [more proper kitty cat](https://twitter.com/crosstyan/status/1606026536246685696) (if you know what I mean) than other anime model, 
but it's still not perfect. As results presented in [Diffusion Art or Digital Forgery? Investigating Data Replication in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03860), the copy and paste effect is still observed.

Anything v3â„¢ has been proven to be the most popular anime model in the community, but it's not perfect either as
described in [JosephusCheung/ACertainThing](https://huggingface.co/JosephusCheung/ACertainThing)

> It does not always stay true to your prompts; it adds irrelevant details, and sometimes these details are highly homogenized. 

BPModel, which has been fine-tuned on a relatively small dataset, is prone
to overfit inherently. This is not surprising given the size of the dataset, but the
strong prior knowledge of ACertainty (full Danbooru) and Stable Diffusion
(LAION) helps to minimize the impact of overfitting.
However I believe it would perform
better than some artist style DreamBooth model which only train with a few
hundred images or even less. I also oppose changing style by merging model since You
could apply different style by training with proper captions and prompting.

Besides some of images in my dataset have the artist name in the caption, however some artist name will
be misinterpreted by CLIP when tokenizing. For example, *as109* will be tokenized as `[as, 1, 0, 9]` and
*fuzichoco* will become `[fu, z, ic, hoco]`. Romanized Japanese suffers from the problem a lot and
I don't have a good solution to fix it other than changing the artist name in the caption, which is
time consuming and you can't promise the token you choose is unique enough. [Remember the sks?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/yju5ks/from_one_of_the_original_dreambooth_authors_stop/)

Language drift problem is still exist. There's nothing I can do unless I can find a way to
generate better caption or caption the image manually. [OFA](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA) 
combined with [convnext-tagger](https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf/wd-v1-4-convnext-tagger) could
provide a better result for SFW content. However fine tune is necessary for NSFW content, which
I don't think anyone would like to do. (Could Unstable Diffusion give us surprise?)

## Cherry Picked Samples

Here're some **cherry picked** samples.

I were using [xformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) when generating these sample 
and it might yield slight different result even with the same seed (welcome to the non deterministic field).
"`Upscale latent space image when doing hires. fix`" is enabled also.

## Usage

The [`bp_1024_e10.ckpt`](bp_1024_e10.ckpt) doesn't include any VAE and you should using other popular VAE in the community when using with [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) or you would see the
LaTeNt SpAcE! 

Use [`bp_1024_with_vae_te.ckpt`](bp_1024_with_vae_te.ckpt) if you don't have VAE and text encoder with you, still
EMA weight is not included and it's fp16.

If you want to continue training, use [`bp_1024_e10_ema.ckpt`](bp_1024_e10_ema.ckpt) which is the ema unet weight 
and with fp32 precision.

For better performance, it is strongly recommended to use Clip skip (CLIP stop at last layers) 2. It's also recommended to use turn on
"`Upscale latent space image when doing hires. fix`" in the settings of [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
which adds intricate details when using `Highres. fix`. 

## About the Model Name

I asked the [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) what the proper explanation of abbreviation BP could be.

```txt
Here are a few more ideas for creative interpretations of the abbreviation "BP":

- Brightest Point - This could refer to a moment of exceptional brilliance or clarity.
- Brainpower - the abbreviation refers to something that requires a lot of mental effort or intelligence to accomplish.
- Bespoke Partition - A custom made section that separates two distinct areas.
- Bukkake Picchi - A Japanese style of rice dish.
- Bokeh Picker - A traditional Japanese photography technique that involves selecting points of light from a digital image.
- Bipolarity - Two distinct and opposing elements or perspectives.

Note that "BP" is often used as an abbreviation for "blood pressure," so it is important to context to determine the most appropriate interpretation of the abbreviation.
```

Personally, I would call it "Big Pot".
