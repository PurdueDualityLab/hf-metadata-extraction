### SD-v-1-5-xaikhwng Dreambooth model trained with my faces (xaikhwng) 

This build is an implementation of [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) on [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5), the model can be used to generate images based on text input. 



This build has been made with the help of Buildspace's [AI Avatar project](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-avatar).
Here's the notebook for you to get started with [buildspace's DreamBooth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/buildspace/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/DreamBooth_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb).


Trained model generates personalized image outputs using subject(Xaikhwng)'s face image input.

- Example prompt : <span style="font-family: 'MonoLisa';">"xaikhwng, man, intricate character portrait, intricate, beautiful, 8k resolution, dynamic lighting, hyperdetailed, quality 3D rendered, volumetric lighting, greg rutkowski, detailed background, artstation character portrait, dnd character portrait"</span>
