# Hitokomoru Diffusion V2

![Anime Girl](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/hitokomoru-diffusion-v2/resolve/main/example_image/thumbnail.png)

A latent diffusion model that has been trained on Japanese Artist artwork, [„Éí„Éà„Åì„ÇÇ„Çã/Hitokomoru](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/30837811). The current model is fine-tuned from [waifu-diffusion-1-4](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4) (`wd-1-4-anime_e2.ckpt`) with a learning rate of `2.0e-6`, 15000 training steps and 4 batch sizes on the `257 artworks` collected from Danbooru. This model supposed to be a continuation of [hitokomoru-diffusion](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/hitokomoru-diffusion/) fine-tuned from Anything V3.0. Dataset has been preprocessed using [Aspect Ratio Bucketing Tool](https://github.com/NovelAI/novelai-aspect-ratio-bucketing) so that it can be converted to latents and trained at non-square resolutions. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports Danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

- Use it with the [`Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion Webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) see: [how-to-use](#howtouse)
- Use it with üß® [`diffusers`](##üß®Diffusers)


# Model Details

- **Developed by:** Linaqruf
- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation model
- **Model type:** This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. 
- **License:** [CreativeML Open RAIL++-M License](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL)
- **Finetuned from model:** [waifu-diffusion-v1-4-epoch-2](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4/blob/main/wd-1-4-anime_e2.ckpt)

## How to Use
- Download the `hitokomoru-v2.ckpt` [here](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/hitokomoru-diffusion-v2/resolve/main/hitokomoru-v2.ckpt), or download the safetensors version [here](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/hitokomoru-diffusion-v2/resolve/main/hitokomoru-v2.safetensors).
- This model is fine-tuned from [waifu-diffusion-v1-4-epoch-2](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4/blob/main/wd-1-4-anime_e2.ckpt), which is also fine-tuned from [stable-diffusion-2-1-base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base). So in order to run this model in [`Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion Webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), you need to put inference config .YAML file next to the model, you can find it [here](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/hitokomoru-diffusion-v2/resolve/main/hitokomoru-v2.yaml)
- You need to adjust your prompt using aesthetic tags, Based [Official Waifu Diffusion 1.4 release notes](https://gist.github.com/harubaru/8581e780a1cf61352a739f2ec2eef09b#prompting), an ideal negative prompt to guide the model towards high aesthetic generations would look like:
```
worst quality, low quality, medium quality, deleted, lowres, comic, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry
```
- And, the following should also be prepended to prompts to get high aesthetic results:
```
masterpiece, best quality, high quality, absurdres
```
## üß® Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information, please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion). You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

You should install dependencies below in order to running the pipeline

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate scipy safetensors
```
Running the pipeline (if you don't swap the scheduler it will run with the default DDIM, in this example we are swapping it to DPMSolverMultistepScheduler):

```python
import torch
from torch import autocast
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler

model_id = "Linaqruf/hitokomoru-diffusion-v2"

# Use the DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (DPM-Solver++) scheduler here instead
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "masterpiece, best quality, high quality, 1girl, solo, sitting, confident expression, long blonde hair, blue eyes, formal dress"
negative_prompt = "worst quality, low quality, medium quality, deleted, lowres, comic, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry"

with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt, 
                 negative_prompt=negative_prompt, 
                 width=512,
                 height=728,
                 guidance_scale=12,
                 num_inference_steps=50).images[0]
    
image.save("anime_girl.png")
```
