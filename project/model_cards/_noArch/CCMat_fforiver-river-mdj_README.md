# DreamBooth model for the fforiver concept trained on the CCMat/forest-river dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the fforiver concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of fforiver river**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `river` images for the landscape theme.

Pretrained Model: prompthero/openjourney



## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('CCMat/fforiver-river-mdj')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```

## Samples

Prompt: "high quality photo of fforiver river along the Colosseum in Rome"
