## Keras Implementation of OCR model for reading captcha ü§ñü¶πüèª

This repo contains the model and the notebook [to this Keras example on OCR model for reading captcha](https://keras.io/examples/vision/captcha_ocr/).

## Background Information 
This example demonstrates a simple OCR model built with the Functional API. Apart from combining CNN and RNN, it also illustrates how you can instantiate a new layer and use it as an "Endpoint layer" for implementing CTC loss. 
This model uses subclassing, learn more about subclassing from [this guide](https://keras.io/guides/making_new_layers_and_models_via_subclassing/).
