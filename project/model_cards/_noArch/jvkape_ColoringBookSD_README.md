This is a trained model used Dreambooth with 35 images and 2500 steps. In the files you have the aesthetic embeddings.

The model was trained using Stable Diffusion version 1.5.

The model is not perfect, but delivers considerable results.

The goal was to make a more simplistic model, since the images naturally generated by SD are more elaborate and full of unnecessary details.

To use it you must download the model and place it in your Stable Diffusion. The model has 2GB. 

You must put in the prompt: ''in VARPJ1 Coloring Book Art Style'' to get the best result.

I hope you like it!
