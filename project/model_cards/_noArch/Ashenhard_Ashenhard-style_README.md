I'm a digital artist learning these new tools to work with, this is my first style model


I'm on Instagram: @ashenhard84 and Twitter: @ashenhard

This model was trained with 85 images, at 8500 steps 1e-6 in Shivam Shrirao Google colab.

I think the potential of this model is to merge it with others.

The token is **Ashenhard style**
