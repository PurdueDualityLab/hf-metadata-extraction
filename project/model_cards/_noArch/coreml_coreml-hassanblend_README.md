# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to [Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion). Conversion instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
  - `original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.<br>
  
# Note: Some models do not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).
# HassanBlend1.5:
Source(s): Hugging Face: [1.4](https://huggingface.co/hassanblend/hassanblend1.4) - [1.5.1.2](https://huggingface.co/hassanblend/HassanBlend1.5.1.2) - [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/1173/hassanblend-1512-and-previous-versions)

I am hassan, I created HassansBlend, the latest version currently is 1.5.1.2 I continue to iterate and improve on this model over time. Feel free to check out our discord or rentry page for more examples with prompts and outputs generated.

This blend is finetuned over SD1.5 with thousands of images included in the dataset it was trained with. Along with that there are some minor merges added in just to soften it up and increase the creativity. 
I have also some custom created content such as enhancement hypernetworks/embeddings etc for patreons or KoFi subscribers only on my pages below
