### LegoStyle1.5 Dreambooth model trained with [TheLastBen's fast-DreamBooth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb) notebook


This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on lego set images.
Use the tokens **_LegoStyle style_** in your prompts for the effect.


Test the concept via A1111 Colab [fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)

```
Positive: LegoStyle style, smooth objects, high resolution
Negative: curve, circle, blurry, drawing, cartoon illustration
```

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
model_id = "sivar/legostyle1-5"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
prompt = "LegoStyle style, smooth objects, high resolution"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("./lego.png")
```

The CreativeML OpenRAIL License specifies: 

1. You can't use the model to deliberately produce nor share illegal or harmful outputs or content 
2. The authors claims no rights on the outputs you generate, you are free to use them and are accountable for their use which must not go against the provisions set in the license
3. You may re-distribute the weights and use the model commercially and/or as a service.
