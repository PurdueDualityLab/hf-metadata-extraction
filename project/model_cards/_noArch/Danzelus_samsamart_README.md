# Samsamart model

**Hi**

I decided to make my own model, in the style of.. you know which artist. I wanted the faces to look little more like real ones, but at the same time keep the style

___
`instance_prompt`:    samsamart style  

Euler a: 20-40

CFG: 4-8

*--- do not use "ugly" as negative prompt! ---*
