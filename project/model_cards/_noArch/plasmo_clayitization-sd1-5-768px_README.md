### Jak's **Clayitization** Image Pack (SD 1.5) for Stable Diffusion



From the makers of [Woolitize](https://huggingface.co/plasmo/woolitize-768sd1-5), another versatile Jak Texture Pack is available to help unleash your Clay-itivity!

Trained using 100 (768px) training images, 8000 training steps, 500 Text_Encoder_steps.


**New: If you want the Stable Diffusion v2.1 model go [HERE](https://huggingface.co/plasmo/clayitization-sd2-1-768px)**

Use Prompt: "**clayitization**" in the beginning of your prompt followed by a word.  *No major prompt-crafting needed*.

Thanks to /u/Jak_TheAI_Artist for creating training images!

Tips: 
- use fewer prompts to make a more raw clay look (eg. "clayitization, brad pitt" made the image below)
- change to square for portraits, and rectangle for dioramas
- add "3d, octane render, intricate details" for more realistic details in the clay
- use 768 resolution or larger images for best results
