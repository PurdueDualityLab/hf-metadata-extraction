# DreamBooth model for the clashgoblin concept trained by GV05 on the GV05/dreambooth-hackathon-images dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the clashgoblin concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of clashgoblin person**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!
