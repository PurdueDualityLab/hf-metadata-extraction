# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

# Elldreth's OG 4060 mix:
Source(s): [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/1259/elldreths-og-4060-mix)

This mixed model is a combination of my all-time favorites. A genuine simple mix of a very popular anime model and the powerful and Zeipher's fantastic f222.

What's it good at?

Realistic portraits
Stylized characters
Landscapes
Fantasy
Sci-Fi
Anime
Horror
It's an all-around easy-to-prompt general purpose semi-realistic to realistic model that cranks out some really nice images. No trigger words required. All models were scanned prior to mixing and totally safe.
