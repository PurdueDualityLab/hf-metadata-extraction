# 【 AniReal 】
Welcome to AniReal! a latent diffusion model Trained and Fine-Tuned on **Photorealistic High Quality** anime illustrations using the **Danbooru** tagging dataset aswell as **Blip** I made it so that it understands some natural text description alongside danbooru tags It may not work as well though but give it a shot! 
The model itself its made to output generally anything with an anime art style if u can think of it u can prompt it!
