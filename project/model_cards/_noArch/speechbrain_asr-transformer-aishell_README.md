# Transformer for AISHELL (Mandarin Chinese)

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform automatic speech
recognition from an end-to-end system pretrained on AISHELL (Mandarin Chinese)
within SpeechBrain. For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

The performance of the model is the following:

| Release | Dev CER | Test CER | GPUs | Full Results |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------:|

## Pipeline description

This ASR system is composed of 2 different but linked blocks:
- Tokenizer (unigram) that transforms words into subword units and trained with
the train transcriptions of LibriSpeech.
- Acoustic model made of a transformer encoder and a joint decoder with CTC +
transformer. Hence, the decoding also incorporates the CTC probabilities.

To Train this system from scratch, [see our SpeechBrain recipe](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/AISHELL-1).

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *transcribe_file* if needed.


## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Transcribing your own audio files (in English)

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR

asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/asr-transformer-aishell", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-transformer-aishell")
asr_model.transcribe_file("speechbrain/asr-transformer-aishell/example_mandarin.wav")

```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

## Parallel Inference on a Batch
Please, [see this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hX5ZI9S4jHIjahFCZnhwwQmFoGAi3tmu?usp=sharing) to figure out how to transcribe in parallel a batch of input sentences using a pre-trained model.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (Commit hash: '986a2175').
To train it from scratch follow these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```bash
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```bash
cd recipes/AISHELL-1/ASR/transformer/
python train.py hparams/train_ASR_transformer.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QU18YoauzLOXueogspT0CgR5bqJ6zFfu?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
