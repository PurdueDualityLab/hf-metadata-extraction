# Karlo v1 alpha

Karlo is a text-conditional image generation model based on OpenAI's unCLIP architecture with the improvement over the standard super-resolution model from 64px to 256px, recovering high-frequency details only in the small number of denoising steps.

* [Original codebase](https://github.com/kakaobrain/karlo)

## Usage

Karlo is available in diffusers!

```python
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors
```
### Text to image

```python
from diffusers import UnCLIPPipeline
import torch

pipe = UnCLIPPipeline.from_pretrained("kakaobrain/karlo-v1-alpha", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to('cuda')

prompt = "a high-resolution photograph of a big red frog on a green leaf."

image = pipe([prompt]).images[0]

image.save("./frog.png")
```

### Image variation

```python
from diffusers import UnCLIPImageVariationPipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image

pipe = UnCLIPImageVariationPipeline.from_pretrained("kakaobrain/karlo-v1-alpha-image-variations", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to('cuda')

image = Image.open("./frog.png")

image = pipe(image).images[0]

image.save("./frog-variation.png")
```

## Model Architecture

### Overview
Karlo is a text-conditional diffusion model based on unCLIP, composed of prior, decoder, and super-resolution modules. In this repository, we include the improved version of the standard super-resolution module for upscaling 64px to 256px only in 7 reverse steps, as illustrated in the figure below:

</p>

In specific, the standard SR module trained by DDPM objective upscales 64px to 256px in the first 6 denoising steps based on the respacing technique. Then, the additional fine-tuned SR module trained by [VQ-GAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/)-style loss performs the final reverse step to recover high-frequency details. We observe that this approach is very effective to upscale the low-resolution in a small number of reverse steps.

### Details
We train all components from scratch on 115M image-text pairs including COYO-100M, CC3M, and CC12M. In the case of Prior and Decoder, we use ViT-L/14 provided by OpenAIâ€™s [CLIP repository](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). Unlike the original implementation of unCLIP, we replace the trainable transformer in the decoder into the text encoder in ViT-L/14 for efficiency. In the case of the SR module, we first train the model using the DDPM objective in 1M steps, followed by additional 234K steps to fine-tune the additional component. The table below summarizes the important statistics of our components:

| | Prior | Decoder | SR |
|:------|----:|----:|----:|
| CLIP | ViT-L/14 | ViT-L/14 | - |
| #param | 1B | 900M | 700M + 700M |
| #optimization steps | 1M | 1M | 1M + 0.2M |
| #sampling steps | 25 | 50 (default), 25 (fast) | 7 |

In the checkpoint links, ViT-L-14 is equivalent to the original version, but we include it for convenience. We also remark that ViT-L-14-stats is required to normalize the outputs of the prior module.

### Evaluation
We quantitatively measure the performance of Karlo-v1.0.alpha in the validation split of CC3M and MS-COCO. The table below presents CLIP-score and FID. To measure FID, we resize the image of the shorter side to 256px, followed by cropping it at the center. We set classifier-free guidance scales for prior and decoder to 4 and 8 in all cases. We observe that our model achieves reasonable performance even with 25 sampling steps of decoder. 

CC3M
| Sampling step | CLIP-s (ViT-B/16) | FID (13k from val)|
|:------|----:|----:|
| Prior (25) + Decoder (25) + SR (7) | 0.3081 | 14.37 |
| Prior (25) + Decoder (50) + SR (7) | 0.3086 | 13.95 |

MS-COCO
| Sampling step | CLIP-s (ViT-B/16) | FID (30k from val)|
|:------|----:|----:|
| Prior (25) + Decoder (25) + SR (7) | 0.3192 | 15.24 |
| Prior (25) + Decoder (50) + SR (7) | 0.3192 | 14.43 |
