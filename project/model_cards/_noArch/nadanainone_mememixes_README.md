Had these for a while, made just as an experiment. I'm only uploading them as an online backup, I don't claim anything except that I'm surprised they output anything coherent at all. Recommend using High res fix at higher resolutions, so the second pass fixes and adds extra detail.

### ABSOLUTE MADMAN mix

A mix of too many models, some which were already mixes on their own. Most were merged on a 0.3 to 0.4 ratio, it was just a dumb experiment tbh, no real science at all. 
The only notable quirk is that it does traditional media weirdly well. 

Models merged include samdoesbimbosmix + anything + eimis + elysium + trinart + hassan + cafe + 852 + my two models from my art + popn model + 4 additional unpublished models i trained separately as an experiment + i forgot they were too many.

Examples:

### FIXER mix

Only called that because it worked well at fixing my own art, it's not only meant for fixing, that's just a dumb name. Regular outputs are ok enough. It has about half the models used + HD + EB

### wheatpopman mix

A mix of istolemyownwheat, popn and an experimental model trained on bleedman (lol). It's alright for thick lineart.
