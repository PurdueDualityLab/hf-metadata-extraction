# Text-to-Speech (TTS) with FastSpeech2 trained on LJSpeech

This repository provides all the necessary tools for Text-to-Speech (TTS)  with SpeechBrain using a [FastSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558) pretrained on [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).

The pre-trained model takes in input a short text and produces a spectrogram in output. One can get the final waveform by applying a vocoder (e.g., HiFIGAN) on top of the generated spectrogram.


## Install SpeechBrain

```
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --editable .           
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform Text-to-Speech (TTS) with FastSpeech2

```
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import FastSpeech2
from speechbrain.pretrained import HIFIGAN

# Intialize TTS (tacotron2) and Vocoder (HiFIGAN)
fastspeech2 = FastSpeech2.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-ljspeech", savedir="tmpdir_tts")
hifi_gan = HIFIGAN.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/tts-hifigan-libritts-16kHz", savedir="tmpdir_vocoder")

# Running the TTS
mel_output, durations, pitch, energy = fastspeech2.encode_text(input_text)

# Running Vocoder (spectrogram-to-waveform)
waveforms = hifi_gan.decode_batch(mel_output)

# Save the waverform
torchaudio.save('example_TTS.wav', waveforms.squeeze(1), 16000)
```

If you want to generate multiple sentences in one-shot, you can do in this way:

```
from speechbrain.pretrained import FastSpeech2
fastspeech2 = FastSpeech2.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-ljspeech", savedir="tmpdir_tts")
items = [
       "A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog",
       "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?",
       "Never odd or even"
     ]
mel_outputs, durations, pitch, energy = fastspeech2.encode_batch(items)

```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain.
To train it from scratch follow these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```bash
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
3. Run Training:
```bash
cd recipes/LJSpeech/TTS/fastspeech2/
python train.py --device=cuda:0 --max_grad_norm=1.0 --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```
You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yb8CDCrW7JF1_jg8Xc4U15z3W37VjrY5?usp=share_link).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
