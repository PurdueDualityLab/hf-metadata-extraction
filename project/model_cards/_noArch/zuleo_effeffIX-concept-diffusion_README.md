# effeffIX Concept Diffusion


Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model, based of ```F222```, trained with concept art from a high quality role playing game.

![Detailed Samples](https://huggingface.co/zuleo/effeffIX-concept-diffusion/resolve/main/booth5.png)

## Model Usage

This model was trained on multiple concepts.  Use the tokens below:

| Token                | Description                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| effeff9 woman        | Uses concepts trained on female designs.             |
| effeff9 man          | Uses concepts trained on male designs.               |
| effeff9 creature     | Uses concepts trained on different creature designs. |
| effeff9 architecture | Uses concepts trained on architecture design.        |

## ‚ùé Negative Prompt Template

This model offers a unique style where characters typically have larger, exaggerated sleeves and hands.  To supress this style, add more variants to adjust the hand style.

All images were rendered with the negative prompt below:

```Negative prompt: ((((ugly)))), (((duplicate))), ((morbid)), ((mutilated)), [out of frame], extra fingers, ((poorly drawn face)), (((mutation))), (((deformed))), ((ugly)), blurry, ((bad anatomy)), ((extra limbs)), cloned face, (((disfigured))), out of frame, extra limbs, (bad anatomy), gross proportions, (malformed limbs), ((missing arms)), ((missing legs)), (((extra arms))), (((extra legs))),  (fused fingers), (too many fingers), (((long neck)))```

## üß® Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

Export the model:
- [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx)
- [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps)
- [FLAX/JAX](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion_jax)

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "zuleo/effeffIX-concept-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "effeff9 woman aubrey plaza"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./i_luv_aubrey_plaza.png")
