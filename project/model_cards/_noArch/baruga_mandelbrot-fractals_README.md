## Description
This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on Mandelbrot fractal images for the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥ science theme. To participate or learn more, visit [this page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon). 

To generate Mandelbrot fractals, use **a photo of mafra fractal in the shape of [your choice]** or experiment with other variations. CFG scale seems to be the best around 8-9. Additional modifiers and negative prompts may also improve results.

## Examples
*a photo of mafra fractal in the shape of a squid.*

## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('baruga/mandelbrot-fractals')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
