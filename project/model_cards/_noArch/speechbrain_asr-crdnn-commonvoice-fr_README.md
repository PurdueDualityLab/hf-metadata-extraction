# CRDNN with CTC/Attention trained on CommonVoice French (No LM)

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform automatic speech
recognition from an end-to-end system pretrained on CommonVoice (French Language) within
SpeechBrain. For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). 

The performance of the model is the following:

| Release | Test CER | Test WER | GPUs |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:| :--------:|
| 07-03-21 | 6.54 | 17.70 | 2xV100 16GB |

## Pipeline description

This ASR system is composed of 2 different but linked blocks:
- Tokenizer (unigram) that transforms words into subword units and trained with
the train transcriptions (train.tsv) of CommonVoice (FR).
- Acoustic model (CRDNN + CTC/Attention). The CRDNN architecture is made of
N blocks of convolutional neural networks with normalization and pooling on the
frequency domain. Then, a bidirectional LSTM is connected to a final DNN to obtain
the final acoustic representation that is given to the CTC and attention decoders.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *transcribe_file* if needed.
## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Transcribing your own audio files (in French)

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR

asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/asr-crdnn-commonvoice-fr", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-crdnn-commonvoice-fr")
asr_model.transcribe_file("speechbrain/asr-crdnn-commonvoice-fr/example-fr.wav")

```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

## Parallel Inference on a Batch
Please, [see this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hX5ZI9S4jHIjahFCZnhwwQmFoGAi3tmu?usp=sharing) to figure out how to transcribe in parallel a batch of input sentences using a pre-trained model.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (986a2175).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd recipes/CommonVoice/ASR/seq2seq
python train.py hparams/train_fr.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13i7rdgVX7-qZ94Rtj6OdUgU-S6BbKKvw?usp=sharing)

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
