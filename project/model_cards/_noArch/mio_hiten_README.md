# Hiten Diffusion

**Welcome to Hiten Diffusion** - a latent diffusion model that has been trained on Chinese TaiWan Artist artwork, [hiten](https://www.pixiv.net/users/490219). The current model has been fine-tuned with a learning rate of `2.0e-6` for `10 Epochs` on `467 images` collected from Danbooru. The model is trained using [NovelAI Aspect Ratio Bucketing Tool](https://github.com/NovelAI/novelai-aspect-ratio-bucketing) so that it can be trained at non-square resolutions. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports Danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "mio/hiten"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "1girl,solo,miku"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./miku.png")
```

## Examples

Below are some examples of images generated using this model:
