Inspired by [unico](https://huggingface.co/Cinnamomo/unico)

I didn't keep good notes on this and I never actually wrote down the mix recipe but iirc it was largely the same as the Castagno recipe but with [bpmodel](https://huggingface.co/Crosstyan/BPModel) and [evt_M](https://huggingface.co/haor/Evt_V4-preview) mixed in.

I can't really recreate this so I'll leave it up for archival purposes. The results aren't really all that good and I don't recommend you use them.
