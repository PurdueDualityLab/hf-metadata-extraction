### SDv1.5 sd15-muppet-blip model trained by Norod78 with [Huggingface Diffusers train_text_to_image script](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/text_to_image/train_text_to_image.py)
## For better results, use an explicit name of a muppet such as "Kermit, Cookie monster, etc" or simply use "muppet"
