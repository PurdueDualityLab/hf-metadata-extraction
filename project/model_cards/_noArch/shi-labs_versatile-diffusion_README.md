# Versatile Diffusion V1.0 Model Card

We built **Versatile Diffusion (VD), the first unified multi-flow multimodal diffusion framework**, as a step towards **Universal Generative AI**. Versatile Diffusion can natively support image-to-text, image-variation, text-to-image, and text-variation, and can be further extended to other applications such as semantic-style disentanglement, image-text dual-guided generation, latent image-to-text-to-image editing, and more. Future versions will support more modalities such as speech, music, video and 3D.

# Model Details

One single flow of Versatile Diffusion contains a VAE, a diffuser, and a context encoder,  and thus handles one task (e.g., text-to-image) under one data type (e.g., image) and one context type (e.g., text). The multi-flow structure of Versatile Diffusion shows in the following diagram:

# Usage

You can use the model both with the [ðŸ§¨Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and the [SHI-Labs Versatile Diffusion codebase](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Versatile-Diffusion).



## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

Diffusers let's you both use a unified and more memory-efficient, task-specific pipelines. 

**Make sure to install `transformers` from `"main"` in order to use this model.**:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

## VersatileDiffusionPipeline

To use Versatile Diffusion for all tasks, it is recommend to use the [`VersatileDiffusionPipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/versatile_diffusion#diffusers.VersatileDiffusionPipeline)

```py
#! pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers diffusers torch
from diffusers import VersatileDiffusionPipeline
import torch
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

pipe = VersatileDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("shi-labs/versatile-diffusion", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

# prompt
prompt = "a red car"

# initial image
url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/images/resolve/main/benz.jpg"
response = requests.get(url)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")

# text to image
image = pipe.text_to_image(prompt).images[0]

# image variation
image = pipe.image_variation(image).images[0]

# image variation
image = pipe.dual_guided(prompt, image).images[0]
```

### Task Specific

The task specific pipelines load only the weights that are needed onto GPU. 
You can find all task specific pipelines [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/versatile_diffusion#versatilediffusion).

You can use them as follows:
### Text to Image
```py
from diffusers import VersatileDiffusionTextToImagePipeline
import torch

pipe = VersatileDiffusionTextToImagePipeline.from_pretrained("shi-labs/versatile-diffusion", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.remove_unused_weights()
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

generator = torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(0)
image = pipe("an astronaut riding on a horse on mars", generator=generator).images[0]
image.save("./astronaut.png")
```
#### Image variations
```py
from diffusers import VersatileDiffusionImageVariationPipeline
import torch
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

# download an initial image
url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/images/resolve/main/benz.jpg"
response = requests.get(url)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")

pipe = VersatileDiffusionImageVariationPipeline.from_pretrained("shi-labs/versatile-diffusion", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

generator = torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(0)
image = pipe(image, generator=generator).images[0]
image.save("./car_variation.png")
```
#### Dual-guided generation 
```py
from diffusers import VersatileDiffusionDualGuidedPipeline
import torch
import requests
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

# download an initial image
url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/images/resolve/main/benz.jpg"

response = requests.get(url)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert("RGB")
text = "a red car in the sun"

pipe = VersatileDiffusionDualGuidedPipeline.from_pretrained("shi-labs/versatile-diffusion", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.remove_unused_weights()
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

generator = torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(0)
text_to_image_strength = 0.75

image = pipe(prompt=text, image=image, text_to_image_strength=text_to_image_strength, generator=generator).images[0]
image.save("./red_car.png")
```

# Cautions, Biases, and Content Acknowledgment

We would like the raise the awareness of users of this demo of its potential issues and concerns. Like previous large foundation models, Versatile Diffusion could be problematic in some cases, partially due to the imperfect training data and pretrained network (VAEs / context encoders) with limited scope. In its future research phase, VD may do better on tasks such as text-to-image, image-to-text, etc., with the help of more powerful VAEs, more sophisticated network designs, and more cleaned data. So far, we have kept all features available for research testing both to show the great potential of the VD framework and to collect important feedback to improve the model in the future. We welcome researchers and users to report issues with the HuggingFace community discussion feature or email the authors.

Beware that VD may output content that reinforces or exacerbates societal biases, as well as realistic faces, pornography, and violence. VD was trained on the LAION-2B dataset, which scraped non-curated online images and text, and may contain unintended exceptions as we removed illegal content. VD in this demo is meant only for research purposes.
