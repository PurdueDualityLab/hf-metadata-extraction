### Jak's **Clayitization** Image Pack (SD2.1) for Stable Diffusion



**clayitization-sd2.1-768px v.1.0**

*THIS IS FOR Stable Diffusion VERSION 2.1*

You MUST also include the **clayitization-SD2.1-768px.yaml** file in the same directory as your model file (will be uploaded here for your convenience)



With this model, other than being trained from SD2.1, you can also mix and match embeddings to your images! 



--------------------

From the makers of [Woolitize](https://huggingface.co/plasmo/woolitize-768sd1-5), another versatile Jak Texture Pack is available to help unleash your Clay-itivity!

Trained using 100 (768px) training images, 8000 training steps, 500 Text_Encoder_steps.



Use Prompt: "**clayitization**" in the beginning of your prompt followed by a word.  *No major prompt-crafting needed*.

Thanks to /u/Jak_TheAI_Artist for creating training images!

Tips: 
- use fewer prompts to make a more raw clay look (eg. "clayitization, brad pitt" made the image below)
- change to square for portraits, and rectangle for dioramas
- add "3d, octane render, intricate details" for more realistic details in the clay
- use 768 resolution or larger images for best results
