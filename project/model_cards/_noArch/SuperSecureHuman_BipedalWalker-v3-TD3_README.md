  # **TD3** Agent playing **BipedalWalker-v3**
  This is a trained model of a **TD3** agent playing **BipedalWalker-v3** using the [stable-baselines3 library](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
  
  This is a model, I trained without much knowledge without knowing what I was doing.
  
  Tried to do this with the help of other code online, after going through the first unit of hugging face RL course.
  
  Hope to learn more :)
