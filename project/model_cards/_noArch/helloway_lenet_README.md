## MindSpore Image Classification models with MNIST on the ðŸ¤—Hub! 

This repository contains the model from [this notebook on image classification with MNIST dataset using LeNet architecture](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.2/model_zoo/official/cv/lenet/README.md#). 

## LeNet Description
Lenet-5 is one of the earliest pre-trained models proposed by Yann LeCun and others in the year 1998, in the research paper Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition. They used this architecture for recognizing the handwritten and machine-printed characters.

The main reason behind the popularity of this model was its simple and straightforward architecture. It is a multi-layer convolution neural network for image classification.
