# Model Card for Stable Diffusion - Universe, 256px
Model developed for the Unit 1 of the [Diffusion Models Class üß®](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusion-models-class).

This model is a diffusion model for unconditional image generation of Universe ü™ê.  
It is trained on a small collection of universe pictures and trained for 50 epochs, with ü§ó Accelerate.

## Usage

```python
from diffusers import DDPMPipeline

pipeline = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained('alkiskoudounas/sd-universe-256px')

```

## Example
Here you can find an example of the output of the model, in a batch of 8 images:
