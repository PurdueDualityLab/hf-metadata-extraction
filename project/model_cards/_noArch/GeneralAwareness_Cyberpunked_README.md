Textual Inversion Embedding by General Awareness For SD 2.x trained on 768x768 images from various sources.

Install by downloading the .pt embedding, and put it in the \embeddings folder.

This embedding was made to do Cyberpunk scenes with Text to Image, or Image to Image even if the prompt includes "cyberpunk" already (also plays VERY nicely with other embeddings).
