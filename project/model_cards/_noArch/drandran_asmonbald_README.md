# Asmongold model.ckpt for Stable Diffusion v1-5 Model Card

Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input. I've trained using Dreambooth 20 images of twitch streamer Asmongold for the purpose of text-to-image illustration generation using Stable Diffusion.

Feel free to download, use and share the model as you like. To give the Ai the trigger to generate an illustration based on the trained Asmongold images, make sure to use the tag "asmonbald" in your prompts.

Example:

a detailed portrait photo of a man

vs

a detailed portrait photo of asmonbald
