This is a SDV1.5 model trained on Lydia Elaine's, aka LotusBubble, artworks.

This model can make portraits decently well, with some editability, but is still somewhat restricting in its capability.
Scenaries and objects are pretty much random, and I haven't check animals.
There is a very slim chance of me updating this model in the future, but it is possible.

To reference the art style, use the token: ltsbbl style
