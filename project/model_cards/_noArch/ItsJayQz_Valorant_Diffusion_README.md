### Valorant Diffusion
This model was trained on the Valorant agents splash arts, and some extra arts on the official website. 
I thought about including the agents trailers and lore videos, but for the art style is slightly ever so different. I might make an updated version which includes them.
The model can do portraits and landscape (possibly animal as well?), but not many objects, or at least not cars.

To reference the art style, use the token: valorant style

There is already an existing model that uses textual inversion. This is trained using Dreambooth instead, whether or not this method is better, I will let you judge.

### Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run Valorant_Diffusion:
