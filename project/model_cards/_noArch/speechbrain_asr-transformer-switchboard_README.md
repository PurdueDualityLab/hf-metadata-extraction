# Transformer for Switchboard (with Transformer LM)

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform automatic speech
recognition from an end-to-end system pretrained on Switchboard (EN) within SpeechBrain. 
For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). 

The performance of the model is the following:

| Release  | Swbd WER | Callhome WER | Eval2000 WER | GPUs        |
|:--------:|:--------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|
| 17-09-22 | 9.80     |  17.89       |  13.94       | 1xA100 40GB |


## Pipeline Description

This ASR system is composed of 3 different but linked blocks:
- Tokenizer (unigram) that transforms words into subword units trained on the Switchboard training transcriptions and the Fisher corpus.
- Neural language model (Transformer LM) trained on the Switchboard training transcriptions and the Fisher corpus.
- Acoustic model made of a transformer encoder and a joint decoder with CTC +
transformer. Hence, the decoding also incorporates the CTC probabilities.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling `transcribe_file` if needed.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

## Transcribing Your Own Audio Files

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR
asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/asr-transformer-switchboard", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-transformer-switchboard")
asr_model.transcribe_file("speechbrain/asr-transformer-switchboard/example.wav")
```

## Inference on GPU

To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

## Parallel Inference on a Batch

Please, [see this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hX5ZI9S4jHIjahFCZnhwwQmFoGAi3tmu?usp=sharing) to figure out how to transcribe in parallel a batch of input sentences using a pre-trained model.

## Training

The model was trained with SpeechBrain (commit hash: `70904d0`).
To train it from scratch follow these steps:

1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```

2. Install it:
```bash
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```bash
cd recipes/Switchboard/ASR/transformer
python train.py hparams/transformer.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

## Limitations

The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.

## Credits

This model was trained with resources provided by the [THN Center for AI](https://www.th-nuernberg.de/en/kiz).
