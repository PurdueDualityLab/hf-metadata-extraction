## üß® Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

Export the model:
- [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx)
- [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps)
- [FLAX/JAX](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion_jax)

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "zuleo/filmation-motu"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "award winning masterpiece illustration of a man, filmation motu style"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./filmation_man.png")
```
