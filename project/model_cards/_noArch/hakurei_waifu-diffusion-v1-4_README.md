# Waifu Diffusion v1.4

Waifu Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model that has been conditioned on high-quality anime images through fine-tuning.

- [Waifu Diffusion 1.4 Anime Epoch 1](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4/blob/main/wd-1-4-anime_e1.ckpt): A test model made to properly ensure that the training setup works.
- [Waifu Diffusion 1.4 Anime Inference Config](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4/blob/main/wd-1-4-anime_e1.yaml): A file included to allow for inference with Automatic's WebUI and with the original Stable Diffusion codebase.
