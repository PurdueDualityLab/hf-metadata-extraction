# Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input.
This model card gives an overview of all available model checkpoints. For more in-detail model cards, please have a look at the model repositories listed under [Model Access](#model-access).

## Stable Diffusion Version 1

For the first version 4 model checkpoints are released.
*Higher* versions have been trained for longer and are thus usually better in terms of image generation quality then *lower* versions. More specifically: 

- **stable-diffusion-v1-1**: The checkpoint is randomly initialized and has been trained on 237,000 steps at resolution `256x256` on [laion2B-en](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en).
  194,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on [laion-high-resolution](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-high-resolution) (170M examples from LAION-5B with resolution `>= 1024x1024`).
- **stable-diffusion-v1-2**: The checkpoint resumed training from `stable-diffusion-v1-1`.
  515,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-improved-aesthetics" (a subset of laion2B-en,
filtered to images with an original size `>= 512x512`, estimated aesthetics score `> 5.0`, and an estimated watermark probability `< 0.5`. The watermark estimate is from the LAION-5B metadata, the aesthetics score is estimated using an [improved aesthetics estimator](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor)).
- **stable-diffusion-v1-3**: The checkpoint resumed training from `stable-diffusion-v1-2`. 195,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-improved-aesthetics" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598)
- **stable-diffusion-v1-4**: The checkpoint resumed training from `stable-diffusion-v1-2`. 195,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-improved-aesthetics" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).
- [**`stable-diffusion-v1-4`**](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4) Resumed from `stable-diffusion-v1-2`.225,000 steps at resolution `512x512` on "laion-aesthetics v2 5+" and 10 % dropping of the text-conditioning to improve [classifier-free guidance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598).

### Model Access

Each checkpoint can be used both with Hugging Face's [ ğŸ§¨ Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) or the original [Stable Diffusion GitHub repository](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion). Note that you have to *"click-request"* them on each respective model repository.
