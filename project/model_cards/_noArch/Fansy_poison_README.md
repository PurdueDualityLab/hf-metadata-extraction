# Poison Model

Welcome to poison model. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Unlike other anime style models, it has a little realistic style(but not too much), especially in the character painting.

It's finetuned from [anything model](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0),and merge back to anything after training.
