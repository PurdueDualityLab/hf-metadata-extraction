# Anything V3 - Better VAE

Welcome to Anything V3 - Better VAE. It currently has three model formats: diffusers, ckpt, and safetensors. You'll never see a grey image result again. This model is designed to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime-style images with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags for image generation.
e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

## Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run Anything V3 with Better VAE:

[![Open In Spaces](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/00380c35e60d6b04be65d3d94a58332be5cc93779f630bcdfc18ab9a3a7d3388/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f25463025394625413425393725323048756767696e67253230466163652d5370616365732d626c7565)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Linaqruf/Linaqruf-anything-v3-better-vae)

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion). You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

You should install dependencies below in order to running the pipeline

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate scipy safetensors
```
Running the pipeline (if you don't swap the scheduler it will run with the default DDIM, in this example we are swapping it to DPMSolverMultistepScheduler):

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler

model_id = "Linaqruf/anything-v3-0-better-vae"

# Use the DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (DPM-Solver++) scheduler here instead
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "masterpiece, best quality, illustration, beautiful detailed, finely detailed, dramatic light, intricate details, 1girl, brown hair, green eyes, colorful, autumn, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, blue sky, falling leaves, garden"
negative_prompt = "lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name"

with autocast("cuda"):
    image = pipe(prompt, 
                 negative_prompt=negative_prompt, 
                 width=512,
                 height=640,
                 guidance_scale=12,
                 num_inference_steps=50).images[0]
    
image.save("anime_girl.png")
```

# Announcement

For (unofficial) continuation of this model, please visit [andite/anything-v4.0](https://huggingface.co/andite/anything-v4.0). I am aware that the repo exists because I am literally the one who (accidentally) gave the idea to publish his fine-tuned model ([andite/yohan-diffusion](https://huggingface.co/andite/yohan-diffusion)) as a base and merged it with many mysterious model, "hey, let's call it 'Anything V4.0'", because the quality is quite similar to Anything V3 but upgraded.

I also wanted to tell you something. I had a plan to remove/make private one of each repo named "Anything V3":
- [Linaqruf/anything-v3.0](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0/)
- [Linaqruf/anything-v3-better-vae](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3-better-vae)

Because there are two versions now and I'm late to realize this mysterious non-sense model is already polluted Huggingface Trending for so long, and now when the new repo comes out it is also there. I feel guilty everytime this model is in trending leaderboard.

I prefer to delete/make private this one and let us slowly move to [Linaqruf/anything-v3-better-vae](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3-better-vae) with better repo management and a better VAE included in the model. 

Please share your thoughts in this #133 discussion about whether I should delete this repo or another one, or maybe both of them.

Thanks,
Linaqruf.
