V2 is here. Trained on 6 styles at once, it allows anyone to create unique but consistent styles by mixing any number of the tokens. Even changing the order of the same list influences results so there's a lot to experiment with here. This was created so anyone could create their comic projects with ease and flexibility. It is the culmination of all my experimentation with dreambooth thus far. 

The tokens for V2 are -
- charliebo artstyle
- holliemengert artstyle
- marioalberti artstyle
- pepelarraz artstyle
- andreasrocha artstyle
- jamesdaly artstyle

None of the artists used are affiliated with this.
