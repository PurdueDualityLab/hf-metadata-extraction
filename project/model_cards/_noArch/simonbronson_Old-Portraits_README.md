# Old Portraits
Using a set of 25 mainly old large format photos from the 19th and early 20th century I wanted to capture the lighting, expression and film artifacts from this era. Subjects range in age, gender & ethnicity with poses generally looking at the camera with a neutral expression.

While only a couple of my source images had distressed frames, plenty of the generations contain them.
