# Core ML Converted Model

This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices by following Apple's instructions [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).<br>
Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>

`split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
`original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.

# Anything V4

Source: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/andite/anything-v4.0)

Welcome to Anything V4 - a latent diffusion model for weebs. The newest version of Anything. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

I think the V4.5 version better though, it's in this repo. feel free 2 try it 


# Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run anything-v4.0:

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "andite/anything-v4.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "hatsune_miku"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./hatsune_miku.png")
```

## Examples

Below are some examples of images generated using this model:

**Anime Girl:**
