# DreamBooth model for the LeDude concept trained by Antiraedus on the Antiraedus/Dude dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the LeDude concept with DreamBooth, which is my 10 year old Australian Silky terrier.

It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of LeDude dog**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description
