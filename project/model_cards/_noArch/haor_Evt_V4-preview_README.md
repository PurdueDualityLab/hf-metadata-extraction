# Evt_V4-preview
EVT series is an experimental project for finetune with large datasets on animation style model.
Evt_V4 uses a larger dataset than before, and its cosine similarity with ACertainty reaches 85%.
It may behave differently from other models, hope you enjoy it.
## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or FLAX/JAX.

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "haor/Evt_V4-preview"
branch_name= "main"

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, revision=branch_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "1girl"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./1girl.png")
```
