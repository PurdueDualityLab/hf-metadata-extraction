# Sound Recognition with ECAPA embeddings on UrbanSoudnd8k

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform sound recognition with SpeechBrain using a model pretrained on UrbanSound8k.
You can download the dataset [here](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)
The provided system can recognize the following 10 keywords:

```
dog_bark, children_playing, air_conditioner, street_music, gun_shot, siren, engine_idling, jackhammer, drilling, car_horn
```

For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The given model performance on the test set is:

| Release | Accuracy 1-fold (%)
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| 04-06-21 | 75.5 | 


## Pipeline description
This system is composed of a ECAPA model coupled with statistical pooling. A classifier, trained with Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, is applied on top of that.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform Sound Recognition

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier
classifier = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/urbansound8k_ecapa", savedir="pretrained_models/gurbansound8k_ecapa")
out_prob, score, index, text_lab = classifier.classify_file('speechbrain/urbansound8k_ecapa/dog_bark.wav')
print(text_lab)
```
The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *classify_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *encode_batch* and *classify_batch*.

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (8cab8b0c).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd recipes/UrbanSound8k/SoundClassification
python train.py hparams/train_ecapa_tdnn.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sItfg_WNuGX6h2dCs8JTGq2v2QoNTaUg?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
