# Texture Diffusion
This DreamBooth model is fine-tuned for diffuse textures. It produces flat textures with very little visible lighting/shadows.

## Samples
Here are a few example images (generated with 50 steps).

| pbr uneven stone wall | pbr dirt with weeds | pbr bright white marble |

| ![](samples/pbr%20uneven%20stone%20wall.png) | ![](samples/pbr%20dirt%20with%20weeds.png) | ![](samples/pbr%20bright%20white%20marble.png) |

## Usage
Use the token `pbr` in your prompts to invoke the style.

This model was made for use in [Dream Textures](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures), a Stable Diffusion add-on for Blender.

You can also use it with [ðŸ§¨ diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers):

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "dream-textures/texture-diffusion"

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "pbr brick wall"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
    
image.save("bricks.png")
```
