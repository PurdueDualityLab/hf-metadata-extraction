## Tensorflow Keras Implementation of an Image Captioning Model with encoder-decoder network. ðŸŒƒðŸŒ…ðŸŽ‘

This repo contains the models and the notebook [on Image captioning with visual attention](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning?hl=en).

## Background Information
This notebook implements TensorFlow Keras implementation on Image captioning with visual attention.
Given an image like the example below, your goal is to generate a caption such as "a surfer riding on a wave".
![image](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/surf.jpg)
To accomplish this, you'll use an attention-based model, which enables us to see what parts of the image the model focuses on as it generates a caption.

The model architecture is similar to [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044).

This notebook is an end-to-end example. When you run the notebook, it downloads the [MS-COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset, preprocesses and caches a subset of images using Inception V3, trains an encoder-decoder model, and generates captions on new images using the trained model.
