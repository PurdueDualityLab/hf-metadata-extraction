## Description
This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the infamous blobfish (often remarked as the ugliest animal in the world) for the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥ animal theme. To participate or learn more, visit [this page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon). 

To generate blobfish images, use **a photo of blofi fish in [your choice]** or experiment with other variations. For some reason, GFC scale 5 seems to give the best results, at 7 images start get "overcooked". Despite multiple training runs with various settings, I couldn't fully solve this problem. Additional modifiers and negative prompts may also improve results.
