### noggles_fastdb_10000_sq on Stable Diffusion via Dreambooth trained on the [fast-DreamBooth.ipynb by TheLastBen](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb) notebook
#### Model by alxdfy
This your the Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned the noggles_fastdb_10000_sq concept taught to Stable Diffusion with Dreambooth.
It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt(s)`: **nounsbud.jpg**

You can also train your own concepts and upload them to the library by using [the fast-DremaBooth.ipynb by TheLastBen](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb).
You can run your new concept via A1111 Colab :[Fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)
Or you can run your new concept via `diffusers`: [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb), [Spaces with the Public Concepts loaded](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sd-dreambooth-library/stable-diffusion-dreambooth-concepts)
