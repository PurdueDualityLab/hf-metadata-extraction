# Anything V4

Welcome to Anything V4 - a latent diffusion model for weebs. The newest version of Anything. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

I think the V4.5 version better though, it's in this repo. feel free 2 try it.

## Yes, this model has [AbyssOrangeMix2](https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs) in it. coz its a very good model. check it out luls ;)

import torch

model_id = "andite/anything-v4.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "hatsune_miku"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./hatsune_miku.png")
```
