# DreamBooth model for the terrier concept trained by bobber on the bobber/Terrier-images dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the terrier concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of terrier dog**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. My daughter helped me selecting 18 images about Terriers from petfind. Hope you enjoy it. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on 18 Terrier `dog` images for the animal theme.


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('bobber/terrier-dog')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
