# Core ML Converted Model

This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices by following Apple's instructions [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).<br>
Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>

`split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
`original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.

# Elldreth's Lucid Mix

This mixed model is a combination of my all-time favorites AND new-found favorite, Dreamlike (thanks to JustMaier for the heads-up). A genuine simple mix of a very popular anime model and the powerful and Zeipher's fantastic f222 mixed in with Dreamlike (minus sd1.5).

### What's it good at?

- Realistic portraits
- Stylized characters
- Landscapes
- Fantasy
- Sci-Fi
- Anime
- Horror

It's an all-around easy-to-prompt general purpose semi-realistic to realistic model that cranks out some really nice images. No trigger words required. All models were scanned prior to mixing and totally safe. If you thought my 4060 mix was awesome.. this one takes the cake, seriously! Great results from simple prompts.
