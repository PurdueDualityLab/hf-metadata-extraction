### kawaiinimal icons (ノ◕ヮ◕)ノ*:・゚✧

![icons overview](https://proximacentaurib.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd087a188-70c6-4a53-bd82-bc6052eff42f%2Fkawaiinimals_overview.jpg?table=block&id=3628f5c5-6bce-460d-bed0-9c51de527898&spaceId=b4561837-08fe-4a03-a305-e7ccc5ef3add&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)


some notes: I will try to improve this model. as of now, prompts might need some extra sauce for good output. modifiers that were used for some of the results above were: `uncropped, isometric, flat colors, vector, 8k, octane, behance hd` (not all of them at once, just played around with them here & there).

results were finished up in photoshop to get a transparent background.

how to prompt: `<your animal of choice> kawaiinimal icon, <modifiers>`
