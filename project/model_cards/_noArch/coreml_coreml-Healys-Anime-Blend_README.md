# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

# Healy's Anime Blend V1.7:
Source(s): [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/1400/healys-anime-blend)

This is a blend of some anime models mixed with "realistic" stuff to get a look i've been trying to accomplish for awhile. Im pretty happy with what it outputs, but judge that for yourself. I can't for the life of me remember what I put into this model.

I take no credit whatsoever, I just smashed rocks together like a caveman and the outcome somehow worked.

It can create NSFW stuff to I think, but i've noticed the outcomes remain pretty tolerable with "cleavage" in the negative prompts.
