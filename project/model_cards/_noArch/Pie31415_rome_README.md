# ROME: Realistic one-shot mesh-based head avatars
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08343) | [Project Page](https://samsunglabs.github.io/rome) | [Github](https://github.com/SamsungLabs/rome)

## Model Description

The ROME models can be used to create a personal avatar from a single image. The resulted meshes can be animated and rendered with photorealistic quality.
To render a ROME avatar with pretrained weights the FLAME Model and DECA weights are required.
