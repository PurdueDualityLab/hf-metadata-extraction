## Description
This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on a 100 ancient/old maps for the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥ wildcard theme. To participate or learn more, visit [this page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon). 

To generate ancient/old maps, use **a photo of ancma map of [your choice]**. Modifiers and negative prompts may improve results. The model is not limited to classic geography, you can try gardens, cave systems, cities, planets, zodiac charts, etc.
