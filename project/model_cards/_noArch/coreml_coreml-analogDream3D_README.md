# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
  - vae-ft-mse-840000-ema embeded

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

# AnalogDream3D:
Source(s): [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/3086/analogdream3d)

It is a Remix Model of the following amazing models:

Analog_diffusion

Dreamlike_photoreal

3DKX_v1.0B

It strongly enhanced the photorealistic power from Analog and DreamLike, and with a good merged method for 3DKX_v1, it come out with the ability for higher resolution ouputs like 1024*768 and more+ !!

you can try to use it to output some of scene,it can handled a lot of describition like hugging and kiss.

I think ,by this merged method, we might try to UPGRADE a large numbers of old model to a higher resolution output level. I also try this recipe with other models, some works, some failed.
