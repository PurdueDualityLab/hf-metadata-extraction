# Stable Diffusion fine tuned on art by [Jannis Mayr](https://www.artstation.com/joblyn)

### Usage
Use by adding the keyword "jannismayr" to the prompt. The model was trained with different classnames, which can also be added to the prompt. These classnames are the second words of the filenames.

## Samples
For this model I experimented and made several versions. I won't bore you with details but there were variations in learning rates and classifications. Just look at the samples and pick the one that looks like it suits you best.
The full images can be found in the files and versions tab as they are quite large.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
