### Paper-Mario-Thousand-Year-Door-map-model Dreambooth model trained by Kagerage with [TheLastBen's fast-DreamBooth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb) notebook


Test the concept via A1111 Colab [fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)

THIS MODEL IS UNFINISHED!!! This model is not representative of my usual finished models, and as of now, produces weird artifacts occasionally, and can't do very wide images/

Sample pictures of this concept:
