# Mann-E 3

_Mann-E_ (read as Mani) is an image generation model originally started and developed by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) in early 2022. This image generation model was originally based on VQGAN, but later in summer 2022, after the release of Stable Diffusion, the base model has been changed.

The main goal of Mann-E project (currently at its version 3.0) is to make AI art and in general, content creation accessible for all people in the world. This model has been released under MIT license and it is part of _really open_ AI projects you may find on the internet!

## Guide

For now, you can use [Colab Notebooks](https://github.com/prp-e/mann-e) we've provided to access this model and enjoy generating art.
