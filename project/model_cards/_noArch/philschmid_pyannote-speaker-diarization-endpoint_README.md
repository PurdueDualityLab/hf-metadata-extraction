# ðŸŽ¹ Speaker diarization

Relies on pyannote.audio 2.0: see [installation instructions](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/tree/develop#installation).


## TL;DR

```python
# load the pipeline from Hugginface Hub
from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization@2022.07")

# apply the pipeline to an audio file
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav")

# dump the diarization output to disk using RTTM format
with open("audio.rttm", "w") as rttm:
    diarization.write_rttm(rttm)
```

## Advanced usage

In case the number of speakers is known in advance, one can use the `num_speakers` option:

```python
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav", num_speakers=2)
```

One can also provide lower and/or upper bounds on the number of speakers using `min_speakers` and `max_speakers` options:

```python
diarization = pipeline("audio.wav", min_speakers=2, max_speakers=5)
```

If you feel adventurous, you can try and play with the various pipeline hyper-parameters.  
For instance, one can use a more aggressive voice activity detection by increasing the value of `segmentation_onset` threshold:

```python
hparams = pipeline.parameters(instantiated=True)
hparams["segmentation_onset"] += 0.1
pipeline.instantiate(hparams)
```

## Benchmark 

### Real-time factor

Real-time factor is around 5% using one Nvidia Tesla V100 SXM2 GPU (for the neural inference part) and one Intel Cascade Lake 6248 CPU (for the clustering part).

In other words, it takes approximately 3 minutes to process a one hour conversation.

### Accuracy

This pipeline is benchmarked on a growing collection of datasets.  

Processing is fully automatic:

* no manual voice activity detection (as is sometimes the case in the literature)
* no manual number of speakers (though it is possible to provide it to the pipeline)
* no fine-tuning of the internal models nor tuning of the pipeline hyper-parameters to each dataset

... with the least forgiving diarization error rate (DER) setup (named *"Full"* in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csl.2021.101254)):

* no forgiveness collar
* evaluation of overlapped speech
