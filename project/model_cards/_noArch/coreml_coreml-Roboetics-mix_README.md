# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

# Roboetic's mix:

This model is some of my favourite models merged together.

It is a general purpose model which can generate good looking images with simpler prompts.
