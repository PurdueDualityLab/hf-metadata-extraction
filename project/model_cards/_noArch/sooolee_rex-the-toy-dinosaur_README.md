# DreamBooth model for the rxty concept trained by sooolee on the sooolee/rexthetoy dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the rxty concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of rxty dinosaur**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `dinosaur` images for the wildcard theme. The model was trained with a learning rate of `1e-06` and `1000` train steps.

## Some Output Examples

Inferences were made with a guidance scale between 8 - 11 and inference steps of 300 - 400.
