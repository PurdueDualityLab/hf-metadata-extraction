  # **RecurrentPPO** Agent playing **CarRacing-v0**
  This is a trained model of a **RecurrentPPO** agent playing **CarRacing-v0** using the [stable-baselines3 library](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
  
  ## Usage (with Stable-baselines3)
  TODO: Add your code
  
 Using recurrent PPO implementation from SB3 contrib: https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib/pull/53
