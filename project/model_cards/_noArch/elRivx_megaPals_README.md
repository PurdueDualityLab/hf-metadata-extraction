# megaPals
Do you remember the superhero vintage animated series? Do you like the 70s style? This model is for you!
Some recomendations: the magic word for your prompts is megaPals . In some times, you would put some prompts like:

request, in megaPals style

or

a cartoon of request, in megaPals style

PS: you can replace 'request' with a person, character, etc.
