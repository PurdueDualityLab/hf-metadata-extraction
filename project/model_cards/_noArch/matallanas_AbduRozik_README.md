# DreamBooth model for the abrozick concept trained by matallanas on the https://huggingface.co/datasets/matallanas/AbduRozik dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the abrozick concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of abrozick**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description
