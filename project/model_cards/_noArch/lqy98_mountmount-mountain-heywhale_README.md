# DreamBooth model for the mountmount concept trained by lqy98.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the mountmount concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of mountmount mountain**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!
