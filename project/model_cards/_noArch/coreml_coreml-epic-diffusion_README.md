# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

Why Epic Diffusion
Epîc Diffusion is a general purpose model based on Stable Diffusion 1.x intended to replace the official SD releases as your default model. It is focused on providing high quality output in a wide range of different styles, with support for NFSW content.

Epîc Diffusion 1.0 is a heavily calibrated merge of SD 1.4, SD 1.5, Analog Diffusion, Wavy Diffusion, Openjourney Diffusion, Samdoesarts Ultramerge, postapocalypse, Elldreth's Dream, Protogen V2.2, Inkpunk Diffusion, Arcane Diffusion & Van Gogh Diffusion blended and reblended multiple times until I got the quality & consistency I was looking for...
