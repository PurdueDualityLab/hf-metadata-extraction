# Conformer for KsponSpeech (with Transformer LM)

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform automatic speech
recognition from an end-to-end system pretrained on KsponSpeech (Kr) within
SpeechBrain. For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). 
The performance of the model is the following:

| Release  | eval clean CER | eval other CER |    GPUs     |
| :------: | :------------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| 09-05-21 |     7.48%      |     8.38%      | 6xA100 80GB |

## Pipeline description

This ASR system is composed of 3 different but linked blocks:
- Tokenizer (unigram) that transforms words into subword units and trained with
the train transcriptions of KsponSpeech.
- Neural language model (Transformer LM) trained on the train transcriptions of KsponSpeech
- Acoustic model made of a conformer encoder and a joint decoder with CTC +
transformer. Hence, the decoding also incorporates the CTC probabilities.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *transcribe_file* if needed.

## Install SpeechBrain
First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain==0.5.10
```
Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).
### Transcribing your own audio files (in Korean)
```
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR
asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="ddwkim/asr-conformer-transformerlm-ksponspeech", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-conformer-transformerlm-ksponspeech",  run_opts={"device":"cuda"})
asr_model.transcribe_file("ddwkim/asr-conformer-transformerlm-ksponspeech/record_0_16k.wav")
```

### Inference on GPU

To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

## Parallel Inference on a Batch

Please, [see this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10N98aGoeLGfh6Hu6xOCH5BbjVTVYgCyB?usp=sharing) on using the pretrained model

### Training

The model was trained with SpeechBrain (Commit hash: 'fd9826c').
To train it from scratch follow these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```bash
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
3. Run Training:
```bash
cd recipes/KsponSpeech/ASR/transformer
python train.py hparams/conformer_medium.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```
You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) at the subdirectories.

### Limitations

The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
