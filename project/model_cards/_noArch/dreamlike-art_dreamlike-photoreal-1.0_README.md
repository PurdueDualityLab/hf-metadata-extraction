# This 1.0 model is OBSOLETE. We've released a new much better 2.0 version!

**Check it out here: [https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0](https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0)**

Dreamlike Photoreal 1.0 is a photorealistic Stable Diffusion 1.5 model fine tuned on high quality photos, made by [dreamlike.art](https://dreamlike.art/).

Use the same prompts as you would for photorealistic SD 1.5 gens. You can also use danbooru style tags for characters (1girl, brown hair, etc.).  
Non-square aspect ratios work better for some prompts. If you want a portrait photo, try using a 3:4 or a 9:16 aspect ratio. If you want a landscape photo, try using a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-1.0"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "caucasian creative man wearing a sweater, sitting, on an icelandic beach"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./result.jpg")
```
