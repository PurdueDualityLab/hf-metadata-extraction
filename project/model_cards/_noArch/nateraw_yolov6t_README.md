# Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

## Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

This model is meant to be used as a general object detector.

## Downstream Use [Optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

You can fine-tune this model for your specific task

## Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->

Don't be evil.

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

This model often classifies objects incorrectly, especially when applied to videos. It does not handle crowds very well.

## Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recomendations.

# Training Details

## Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Data Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

[More Information Needed]

## Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

### Preprocessing

[More Information Needed]

### Speeds, Sizes, Times

<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->

# Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Data Card if possible. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Factors

<!-- These are the things the evaluation is disaggregating by, e.g., subpopulations or domains. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->

# Environmental Impact

<!-- Total emissions (in grams of CO2eq) and additional considerations, such as electricity usage, go here. Edit the suggested text below accordingly -->

Carbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).
