Celeste is a general-purpose stable diffusion illustrations model. She seems to perform well with a smaller amount of prompts.

As it can be seen in the pictures below, she has been tested on a diverse variety of prompts, delivering quite good and fairly artistic results.

The example images have been generated using Celeste.ckpt at a low resolution and have been later upscaled using an upscaling algorithm since my
GPU does not support any resolutions above 700x700.
