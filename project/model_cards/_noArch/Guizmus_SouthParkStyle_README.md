# SouthPark Style

<p>
	<img alt="Showcase" src="https://huggingface.co/Guizmus/SouthParkStyle/resolve/main/showcase_southRick.jpg"/><br/>
	This model was based on <a href="https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5">RunwayML 1.5</a> model with updated VAE.<br/>
	The dataset is made mostly of South Park characters and scenary, with some regularisation around Rick Roll and Fullbody Shots photography.<br/>
	99 total pictures in the dataset, 800 repeats total each, over 16 Epoch on LR1e-6 (around 79k unitary steps).<br/>
	This was trained using EveryDream with a full caption of all training pictures.<br/>
	<br/>
	The style will be called by the use of the token <b>SouthPark Style</b>, and the tokens <b>Rick Roll</b> and <b>FullBody Shot</b> have also been refined.<br/>
	<br/>

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "Guizmus/SouthParkStyle"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "Yoda SouthPark Style"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./SouthParkStyle.png")
```
