# ResNet-like model

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform enhancement and
robust ASR training (EN) within
SpeechBrain. For a better experience we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The model performance is:

| Release | Test PESQ | Test COVL | Valid WER | Test WER |
|:--------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 22-06-21 | 3.05 | 3.74 | 2.89 | 2.80 |

Works with SpeechBrain v0.5.12

## Pipeline description

The mimic loss training system consists of three steps:

1. A perceptual model is pre-trained on clean speech features, the
same type used for the enhancement masking system.
2. An enhancement model is trained with mimic loss, using the
pre-trained perceptual model.
3. A large ASR model pre-trained on LibriSpeech is fine-tuned
using the enhancement front-end.

The enhancement and ASR models can be used together or
independently.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

## Pretrained Usage

To use the mimic-loss-trained model for enhancement, use the following simple code:

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import WaveformEnhancement

enhance_model = WaveformEnhancement.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/mtl-mimic-voicebank",
    savedir="pretrained_models/mtl-mimic-voicebank",
)
enhanced = enhance_model.enhance_file("speechbrain/mtl-mimic-voicebank/example.wav")

# Saving enhanced signal on disk
torchaudio.save('enhanced.wav', enhanced.unsqueeze(0).cpu(), 16000)
```

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *enhance_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *enhance_batch* as in the example.


### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (150e1890).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd  recipes/Voicebank/MTL/ASR_enhance
python train.py hparams/enhance_mimic.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HaR0Bq679pgd1_4jD74_wDRUq-c3Wl4L?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
