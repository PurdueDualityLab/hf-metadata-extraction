# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

Creative Ladies and artsy Gentle-beings i present to you great all-around checkpoint that was secretly made by Reddit user Virtual-Fix6855 by using recipe of forgotten Old Gods which he probably also forgot. For a well-designed prompt it could give out great photo-realistic images as well as digital paintings. It does not fail on bodies and landscapes and with proper resolution you can count on humans having right amount of everything. 

Sharing is caring, use it for your entertainment and more.
