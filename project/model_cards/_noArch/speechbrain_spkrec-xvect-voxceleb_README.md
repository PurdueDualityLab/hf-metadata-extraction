# Speaker Verification with xvector embeddings on Voxceleb

This repository provides all the necessary tools to extract speaker embeddings with a pretrained TDNN model using SpeechBrain. 
The system is trained on Voxceleb 1+ Voxceleb2 training data. 

For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The given model performance on Voxceleb1-test set (Cleaned) is:

| Release | EER(%) 
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| 05-03-21 | 3.2 | 


## Pipeline description
This system is composed of a TDNN model coupled with statistical pooling. The system is trained with Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss.  

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Compute your speaker embeddings

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier
classifier = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb", savedir="pretrained_models/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb")
signal, fs =torchaudio.load('tests/samples/ASR/spk1_snt1.wav')
embeddings = classifier.encode_batch(signal)
```

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *classify_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *encode_batch* and *classify_batch*.

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (aa018540).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd  recipes/VoxCeleb/SpeakerRec/
python train_speaker_embeddings.py hparams/train_x_vectors.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RtCBJ3O8iOCkFrJItCKT9oL-Q1MNCwMH?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
