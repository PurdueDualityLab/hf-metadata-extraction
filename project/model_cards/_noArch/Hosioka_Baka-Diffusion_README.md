# Baka Diffusion V1
Welcome to Baka-Diffusion! a latent diffusion model Trained and Fine-Tuned on **High Quality** images using the **Danbooru** tagging dataset! our models are made to output better lighting and quality with just a few tags!


e.g. **_masterpiece, best quality, 1girl, hakurei reimu, chromatic aberration, white background,_**
________


# **The model was made to use with Latent Space Upscaling in mind** 
*Below are some examples generated with this model!*
<img src=https://s1.fileditch.ch/ansGBCGYWyDhaJJGTnE.png width=100% height=100%>
```
masterpiece, best quality, 1girl, hakurei reimu, chromatic aberration, white background,
Negative prompt: lowres, (bad anatomy), text, cropped, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, artist name, (out of frame), black and white, obese
```


# Versions!
Our models have 2 versions FP16 and FP32 from my testing FP32 can create more complex backgrounds where as for the FP16 it creates simpler backgrounds

# Usage!
- DPM++ SDE Karras seems to be the best sampler for BakaV1
- ClipSkip 1
- Upscaler (Latent)
- Denoise Strength (0.5~0.7)
- below 0.5 Denoise Blocking can occur 

## Changelog!
- Removed Ckpt versions   1/16/23
- Added Diffuser weights! 1/16/23
- Model page overhaul     1/16/23

  ## This Project would be impossible without 
- [HaisenBerg](https://huggingface.co/haisenberguwu)

# Baka-Diffusion Version2
Baka-DiffusionV2 has been delayed :( I have been working on the model for weeks and have come to a dead end, There were working test versions but the quality isn't as notable as i thought it would be, It felt like a Version1.5 than a V2 so i have restarted my entire procress but eventually it will come out but I cannot pin point an exact date so please be patient!
