### JWST Deep Space Diffusion

This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (based on v1.5) trained on images taken by the **_James Webb Space Telescope_**, as well as Judy Schmidt. Use the token **_JWST_** in your prompts to use the style (e.g., "jwst, green spiral galaxy").

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().
