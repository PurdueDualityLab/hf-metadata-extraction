# Gerph
Welcome to the Gerph model. This model is trained in the art of the talented artist Gerph and has three versions for you to choose from.

These models can be highly NSFW and are trained mainly on characters, as the work primarily focuses on this subject.
 Take a look at the demo images below to see the differences between the three versions. And don't forget that these models is licensed under the Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license. Enjoy!

**Gerph_Epoch8**

**Gerph_Epoch10**

> close up, male, solo, long hair, blonde hair, blue eyes, bishounen, colorful, boy, autumn, cinematic lighting, blue sky

**Gerph_Epoch11**

> young girl, brown hair, green eyes, colorful, winter, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, blue sky

As you can see, the base version, *Gerph_Epoch8*, is trained exclusively in Gerph's art and offers a unique take on his style and themes. If you are a fan of Gerph's art, this version should certainly be in your set. *Gerph_Epoch10* and *Gerph_Epoch11* were continued with a wider range of concept images and work by various artists, so unfortunately the original Gerph style doesn't shine as much. Also, these models do not require any specific tokens.
