#### Realistic Lucy Edgerunners models

Trained on SD1.5

Our beloved Lucy who tends to realism !
There are two models, the main is more Lucy accurate but less style transferrable, the second '-creative' tend to do really cool style blending with an overral subject feeling (lucy hair shape, hair colors) but her suit is sometimes chaotic.
