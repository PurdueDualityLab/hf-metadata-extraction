Textual Inversion Embedding by General Awareness For SD 2.x trained on 768x768 images from various sources.

Install by downloading the .pt embedding, and put it in the \embeddings folder.

The two embeddings are a one two punch as Vint-3000 is more 1880s style of photography (some seeds will be different) while the Vint is more for 1940s onward though both can be used for anything you can dream of.

Use keyword: vint, or vint-3000 depending on the embedding, and effect you are trying to achieve.
