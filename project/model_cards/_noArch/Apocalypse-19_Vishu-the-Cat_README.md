This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥.

## Description


Model finetuned on the pictures of our cat named Vishu, made for the Dreambooth Hackathon,
finetuned on Stable diffusion 2.1 Base


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('Apocalypse-19/Vishu-the-Cat')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```


## Examples

Some examples of images generated with their prompts are (Guidance scale = 7.5 and Number of Inference steps = 50 for all):
