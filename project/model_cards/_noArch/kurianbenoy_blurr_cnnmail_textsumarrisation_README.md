## Fine-tuned Text Summarization Model - CNNMail (blurr model)

This model is trained as shown in [the link](https://github.com/kurianbenoy/chaloRR/blob/master/TextSummarisation_Seq2Seq.ipynb).

Most of the code is developed based on [blurr tutorial on modelling with mid-level APIs](https://ohmeow.github.io/blurr/text-modeling-seq2seq-summarization.html#Mid-level-API)
