### Classic Telltale Diffusion
This model was trained on arts from gameplay footage across most Telltale classic games, and some game advertisements.
The art style can essentially be described as 2D comic arts but in 3D.
The model can do portraits, landscapes, and cars, though I have yet to try generating animals.

To reference the art style, use the token: telltale style
