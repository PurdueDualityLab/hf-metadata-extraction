# Harrier Du Bois

Meet the [Harrier Du Bois](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Harrier_Du_Bois).

A disco elysium style Stable Diffusion model I trained a long time ago.
Trained with [Disco Elysium Archetypes](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6aAL8x) from [Aleksander Rostov](https://www.artstation.com/rostovjanka)
and some painitng from [Craig Mullins](http://www.goodbrush.com). 
You might have seen it somewhere else. 

Based on a novel model we all know. 

Text encoder is trained and broken. **Very unwieldy** but interesting enough.

## Usage

No VAE.

[swapping attention layers](https://gist.github.com/crosstyan/95d14111e8e1eeb3348ef947818b338f)
might give interesting result.
