# DreamBooth model for the duckduck concept trained by shadow.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the duckduck concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of duckduck roast_duck**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `roast_duck` images for the food theme, 
for the Hugging Face DreamBooth Hackathon, from the HF CN Community, 
corporated with the HeyWhale.
