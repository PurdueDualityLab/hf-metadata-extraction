# Anything V3

Welcome to Anything V3 - a latent diffusion model for weebs. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. **_1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden_** 

## Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run Anything-V3.0:

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "Linaqruf/anything-v3.0"
branch_name= "diffusers"

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, revision=branch_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "pikachu"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./pikachu.png")
```

## Examples

Below are some examples of images generated using this model:
