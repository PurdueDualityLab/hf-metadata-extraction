### Painting Generator
**Convert your photos and artworks into paintings.**
Use **concep** to activate for example: concep, forest, trees etc. 

Model trained on brushstrokes, you don't need to put any artist names or style to get nice results. 
Best to use in img2img mode and inpainting

Download the ckpt file from "files and versions" tab into the stable diffusion models folder of your web-ui of choice
