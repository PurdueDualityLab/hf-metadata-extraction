## Paint Journey V2 is [V1](https://huggingface.co/FredZhang7/paint-journey-v1) fine-tuned on 768x768 oil paintings by Midjourney V4, Open Journey V2, Disco Diffusion, and artists given permission

Begin the prompt with **((oil painting))** to add the oil paint effect. For digital and other painting styles, use similar prompts as you would for Midjourney V4 (with some tweaks), Stable Diffusion v1.5 (add more styles), Open Journey V2, or Disco Diffusion.

## Comparisons

Paint Journey V2's paintings are closer to human-drawn art than Open Journey V2.
Compared to models like Dreamlike Diffusion 1.0, PJ V2 tends to generate 768x768 or higher resolution images with reduced noise levels.
This model is also capable of generating stunning portraits at 768x1136 resolution without duplicated faces (with [Camenduru's WebUI](https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui)), a difficult task to models like DreamShaper 3.3.

At lower resolutions, DreamShaper 3.3 tends to generate higher quality portraits than PJ V2 in terms of noise levels, given the same (short) postive and negative prompts.
However, PJ V2 can craft more stunning masterpieces with more descriptive positive and negative prompts and can still generate beautiful landscapes with shorter prompts.


## Training
Instead of solely fine-tuning its Unet, Paint Journey V2 focuses on fine-tuning its text encoder with a diverse range of prompts.
This allows for a seamless blend of the digital and oil painting styles into various other types of prompts, resulting in a more natural and dynamic output.

This model was trained on a curated dataset of roughly 300 images hand-picked from Midjourney, [Prompt Hero](https://prompthero.com/), [PixaBay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/paintings/), Open Journey V2, and Reddit.
Before training, I used R-ESRGAN 4x on many images to increase their resolution and reduce noise.

## Output Dimensions
Portrait sizes include, but are not limited to, `512x768`, `768x768`, and `768x1136`.
Landscape sizes include, but are not limited to, `768x512`, `768x768`, `1152x768`, and `1280x768`.

## Safety Checker V2

The official [stable diffusion safety checker](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-safety-checker) uses up 1.22GB VRAM.
I recommend using [Google Safesearch Mini V2](https://huggingface.co/FredZhang7/google-safesearch-mini-v2) (220MB) to save 1.0GB VRAM.
