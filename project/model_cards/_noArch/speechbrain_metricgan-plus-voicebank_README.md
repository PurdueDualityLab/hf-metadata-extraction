# MetricGAN-trained model for Enhancement

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform enhancement with
SpeechBrain. For a better experience we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The model performance is:

| Release | Test PESQ | Test STOI |
|:-----------:|:-----:| :-----:|
| 21-04-27 | 3.15 | 93.0 |

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

## Pretrained Usage

To use the mimic-loss-trained model for enhancement, use the following simple code:

```python
import torch
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import SpectralMaskEnhancement

enhance_model = SpectralMaskEnhancement.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/metricgan-plus-voicebank",
    savedir="pretrained_models/metricgan-plus-voicebank",
)

# Load and add fake batch dimension
noisy = enhance_model.load_audio(
    "speechbrain/metricgan-plus-voicebank/example.wav"
).unsqueeze(0)

# Add relative length tensor
enhanced = enhance_model.enhance_batch(noisy, lengths=torch.tensor([1.]))

# Saving enhanced signal on disk
torchaudio.save('enhanced.wav', enhanced.cpu(), 16000)
```

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *enhance_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *enhance_batch* as in the example.

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (d0accc8).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd  recipes/Voicebank/enhance/MetricGAN
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fcVP52gHgoMX9diNN1JxX_My5KaRNZWs?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
