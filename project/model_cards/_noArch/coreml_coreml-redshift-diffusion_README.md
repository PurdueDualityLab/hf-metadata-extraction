# Core ML Converted Model

This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices by following Apple's instructions [here](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).<br>
Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>

`split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>
`original` version is only compatible with CPU & GPU option.

### Redshift Diffusion

This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on high resolution 3D artworks.
Use the tokens **_redshift style_** in your prompts for the effect.

**The name:** I used Cinema4D for a very long time as my go-to modeling software and always liked the redshift render it came with. That is why I was very sad to see the bad results base SD has connected with its token. This is my attempt at fixing that and showing my passion for this render engine.

#### Prompt and settings for Tony Stark:
**(redshift style) robert downey jr as ironman Negative prompt: glasses helmet**
_Steps: 40, Sampler: DPM2 Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 908018284, Size: 512x704_

#### Prompt and settings for the Ford Mustang:
**redshift style Ford Mustang**
_Steps: 20, Sampler: DPM2 Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 579593863, Size: 704x512_

This model was trained using the diffusers based dreambooth training by ShivamShrirao using prior-preservation loss and the _train-text-encoder_ flag in 11.000 steps.

### Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI run redshift-diffusion:

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "nitrosocke/redshift-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "redshift style magical princess with golden hair"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./magical_princess.png")
```
