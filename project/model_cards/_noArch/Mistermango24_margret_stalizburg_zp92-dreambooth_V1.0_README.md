here is a dreambooth from a zp92 by margret stalizburg.

prompt keyword: "margret_stalizburg or margretstalizburg" (ie, no text on here "margret stalizburg" only what is written on it in the text, you can try the prompt if you like but normally only "margret_stalizburg" prompt works.)

I trained it on about 82 images from e621, 10000 steps over yiffy e18 and version model on "1.5".

with the generator, that would be set to 20-80 steps and with the (cfg 7.) whatever you want and what you take the model database, I recommend on realesrgan-x4plus, realesrgan-x4plus anime and realesrgan-x4plus V3 take this one, because the picture still looks good quality.

Then I would recommend restore faces, which still beautify this image well and highres fix can also be set (default image size to 512x512)

what i used with dreambooth would be that with dreambooth almost for google colab that i took something lighter and easily build creatively with model.

I finally managed to do this on dreambooth, that would be on version 1.0.
but don't worry! in the future if there is anything new I would come up with an expanded picture.

I have found advanced plugins that beautify these images and make them better.
