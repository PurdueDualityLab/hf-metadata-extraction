# DreamBooth model for fatchonkyyoshi trained by lazzdw on the lazzdw/fatyoshi-dreambooth-hackathon-images dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the fatchonkyyoshi concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **fatchonkyyoshi**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `fatyoshi` images for the wildcard theme. Fat Yoshi is also known as Big Yoshi. Inspired by one of my favourite playlists https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9gHC2quF3A. Go check it out ðŸ˜Š
