## AbyssOrangeMix3 (AOM3)

![](https://github.com/WarriorMama777/imgup/raw/main/img/AOM3/AOM3_G_Top_comp001.webp "")

‚Äï‚ÄïEveryone has different ‚ÄúABYSS‚Äù!

‚ñºAbout

The main model, "AOM3 (AbyssOrangeMix3)", is a purely upgraded model that improves on the problems of the previous version, "AOM2". "AOM3" can generate illustrations with very realistic textures and can generate a wide variety of content. There are also three variant models based on the AOM3 that have been adjusted to a unique illustration style. These models will help you to express your ideas more clearly.

‚ñºLinks

- [‚ö†NSFW] Civitai: AbyssOrangeMix3 (AOM3) | Stable Diffusion Checkpoint | https://civitai.com/models/9942/abyssorangemix3-aom3

### UPDATE NOTE

- 2023-04-01: Added description of AOM3A1 cursed by Dreamlike
- 2023-03-11: Change model name : () to _  
Changed to _ because an error occurs when using () in the Cloud environment(e.g.:paperspace).  
"ModelName + _orangemixs"  
- 2023-03-10: Model name fix  
I found that I abbreviated the model name too much, so that when users see illustrations using OrangeMixs models on the web, they cannot reach them in their searches.  
To make the specification more search engine friendly, I renamed it to "ModelName + (orangemixs)".  
- 2023-02-27: Add AOM3A1B  

### AOM3

Features: high-quality, realistic textured illustrations can be generated.  
There are two major changes from AOM2.

1: Models for NSFW such as _nsfw and _hard have been improved: the models after nsfw in AOM2 generated creepy realistic faces, muscles and ribs when using Hires.fix, even though they were animated characters. These have all been improved in AOM3.

e.g.: explanatory diagram by MEME : [GO TO MEME ZONE‚Üì](#MEME_realface)

2: sfw/nsfw merged into one model. Originally, nsfw models were separated because adding NSFW content (models like NAI and gape) would change the face and cause the aforementioned problems. Now that those have been improved, the models can be packed into one.  
In addition, thanks to excellent extensions such as [ModelToolkit](https://github.com/arenatemp/stable-diffusion-webui-model-toolkit
), the model file size could be reduced (1.98 GB per model).

‚ñºVariations

### AOM3A1

‚õîOnly this model (AOM3A1) includes ChilloutMix. The curse of the DreamLike license. In other words, only AOM3A1 is not available for commercial use. I recommend AOM3A1B instead.‚õî
[GO TO MEME ZONE‚Üì](#MEME_AOM3A1)

Features: Anime like illustrations with flat paint. Cute enough as it is, but I really like to apply LoRA of anime characters to this model to generate high quality anime illustrations like a frame from a theatre version.

 ### AOM3A2

Features: Oil paintings like style artistic illustrations and stylish background depictions. In fact, this is mostly due to the work of Counterfeit 2.5, but the textures are more realistic thanks to the U-Net Blocks Weight Merge.

 ### AOM3A3

Features: Midpoint of artistic and kawaii. the model has been tuned to combine realistic textures, a artistic style that also feels like an oil colour style, and a cute anime-style face. Can be used to create a wide range of illustrations.

### AOM3A1B

AOM3A1B added. This model is my latest favorite. I recommend it for its moderate realism, moderate brush touch, and moderate LoRA conformity.  
The model was merged by mistakenly selecting 'Add sum' when 'Add differences' should have been selected in the AOM3A3 recipe. It was an unintended merge, but we share it because the illustrations produced are consistently good results.  
In my review, this is an illustration style somewhere between AOM3A1 and A3.

### MORE
In addition, these U-Net Blocks Weight Merge models take numerous steps but are carefully merged to ensure that mutual content is not overwritten.  

(Of course, all models allow full control over adult content.)
- üîê When generating illustrations for the general public: write "nsfw" in the negative prompt field
- üîû ~~When generating adult illustrations: "nsfw" in the positive prompt field~~ -> It can be generated without putting it in. If you include it, the atmosphere will be more NSFW.

### Description for enthusiast

AOM3 was created with a focus on improving the nsfw version of AOM2, as mentioned above.The AOM3 is a merge of the following two models into AOM2sfw using U-Net Blocks Weight Merge, while extracting only the NSFW content part.  
(1) NAI: trained in Danbooru  
(2)gape: Finetune model of NAI trained on Danbooru's very hardcore NSFW content.  
In other words, if you are looking for something like AOM3sfw, it is AOM2sfw.The AOM3 was merged with the NSFW model while removing only the layers that have a negative impact on the face and body.   However, the faces and compositions are not an exact match to AOM2sfw.AOM2sfw is sometimes superior when generating SFW content. I recommend choosing according to the intended use of the illustration.See below for a comparison between AOM2sfw and AOM3.

![](https://github.com/WarriorMama777/imgup/raw/main/img/AOM3/img_modelComparison_AOM_comp001.webp "modelComparison_AOM")


‚ñºA summary of the AOM3 work is as follows

1. investigated the impact of the NAI and gape layers as AOM2 _nsfw onwards is crap.  
2. cut face layer: OUT04 because I want realistic faces to stop ‚Üí Failed. No change.  
3. gapeNAI layer investigationÔΩú  
  a. (IN05-08 (especially IN07) | Change the illustration   significantly. Noise is applied, natural colours are lost, shadows die, and we can see that the IN deep layer is a layer of light and shade.  
  b. OUT03-05(?) | likely to be sexual section/NSFW layer.Cutting here will kill the NSFW.  
  c. OUT03,OUT04ÔΩúNSFW effects are in(?). e.g.: spoken hearts, trembling, motion lines, etc...  
  d. OUT05ÔΩúThis is really an NSFW switch. All the "NSFW atmosphere" is in here. Facial expressions, Heavy breaths, etc...  
  e. OUT10-11ÔΩúPaint layer. Does not affect detail, but does have an extensive impact.  
1. (mass production of rubbish from here...)   
2. cut IN05-08 and merge NAIgape with flat parameters ‚Üí avoided creepy muscles and real faces. Also, merging NSFW models stronger has less impact.  
3. so, cut IN05-08, OUT10-11 and merge NAI+gape with all others 0.5.  
4. ‚Üí AOM3  
AOM3 roughly looks like this

Prompt: [https://majinai.art/ja/i/nxpKRpw](https://majinai.art/ja/i/nxpKRpw)

‚ñºAbout

AbyssOrangeMix2 (AOM2) is an AI model capable of generating high-quality, highly realistic illustrations.
It can generate elaborate and detailed illustrations that cannot be drawn by hand. It can also be used for a variety of purposes, making it extremely useful for design and artwork.
Furthermore, it provides an unparalleled new means of expression.
It can generate illustrations in a variety of genres to meet a wide range of needs. I encourage you to use "Abyss" to make your designs and artwork richer and of higher quality.

‚Äªnvidia joke.

‚ñºDescription for engineers/enthusiasts

The merged model was formulated using an extension such as sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui, which merges models at separate rates for each of the 25 U-Net blocks (input, intermediate, and output).
The validation of many Anons has shown that such a recipe can generate a painting style that is anatomically realistic enough to feel the finger skeleton, but still maintains an anime-style face.

The changes from AbyssOrangeMix are as follows.

1. the model used for U-Net Blocks Weight Merge was changed from Instagram+F222 to BasilMix. (<https://huggingface.co/nuigurumi>)

This is an excellent merge model that can generate decent human bodies while maintaining the facial layers of the Instagram model. Thanks!!!
This has improved the dullness of the color and given a more Japanese skin tone (or more precisely, the moisturized white skin that the Japanese would ideally like).
Also, the unnatural bokeh that sometimes occurred in the previous version may have been eliminated (needs to be verified).

2.Added IN deep layers (IN06-11) to the layer merging from the realistic model (BasilMix).

It is said that the IN deep layer (IN06-11) is the layer that determines composition, etc., but perhaps light, reflections, skin texture, etc., may also be involved.
It is like "Global Illumination", "Ray tracing" and "Ambient Occlusion" in 3DCG.

<img src="https://github.com/WarriorMama777/imgup/raw/main/img/AbyssOrangeMix2/AbyssOrangeMix2_comparison_comp001.webp"  width="" height="" alt=‚ÄùAbyssOrangeMix2_comparison_comp001‚Äù>

‚ÄªThis does not fundamentally improve the fingers. Therefore, More research needs to be done to improve the fingers (e.g. '[bad_prompt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/bad_prompt)').
About 30-50% chance of generating correct fingers(?). Abyss is deep.

‚ñºSample Gallery

The prompts for generating these images were all generated using ChatGPT. I simply asked "Pirates sailing the oceans" to tell me what the prompts were.  
However, to make sure the AI understood the specifications, I used the template for AI questions (Question template for AI prompt generation(v1.2) ).
Please review the following.

```jsx
https://seesaawiki.jp/nai_ch/d/AI%a4%f2%b3%e8%cd%d1%a4%b7%a4%bf%a5%d7%a5%ed%a5%f3%a5%d7%a5%c8%c0%b8%c0%ae
```

The images thus generated, strangely enough, look like MidJourney or Nijijourney illustrations. Perhaps they are passing user prompts through GPT or something else before passing them on to the image AIü§î

## EerieOrangeMix (EOM)

EerieOrangeMix is the generic name for a U-Net Blocks Weight Merge Models based on Elysium(Anime V2).  
Since there are infinite possibilities for U-Net Blocks Weight Merging, I plan to treat all Elysium-based models as a lineage of this model.

‚ÄªThis does not fundamentally improve the fingers. Therefore, More research needs to be done to improve the fingers (e.g. '[bad_prompt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/bad_prompt)').

### EerieOrangeMix (EOM1)

‚ñº?  

This merge model is simply a U-Net Blocks Weight Merge of ElysiumAnime V2 with the AbyssOrangeMix method.

The AnythingModel is good at cute girls anyway, and no matter how hard I try, it doesn't seem to be good at women in their late 20s and beyond. Therefore, I created a U-Net Blocks Weight Merge model based on my personal favorite ElysiumAnime V2 model. ElyOrangeMix was originally my favorite, so this is an enhanced version of that.

## AbyssOrangeMix (AOM)

‚Äï‚ÄïHow can you guys take on such a deep swamp and get results?  
Is it something like "Made in Abyss"?

‚ñº?

The merged model was formulated using an extension such as sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui, which merges models at separate rates for each of the 25 U-Net blocks (input, intermediate, and output).
The validation of many Anons has shown that such a recipe can generate a painting style that is anatomically realistic enough to feel the finger skeleton, but still maintains an anime-style face.

‚ÄªThis model is the result of a great deal of testing and experimentation by many Anonsü§ó
‚ÄªThis model can be very difficult to handle. I am not 100% confident in my ability to use this model. It is peaky and for experts.  
‚ÄªThis does not fundamentally improve the fingers, and I recommend using bad_prompt, etc. (Embedding) in combination.

‚ñºHow to use

- VAE: orangemix.vae.pt
- ~~Prompts can be long or short~~  
As simple as possible is good. Do not add excessive detail prompts. Start with just this.
(worst quality, low quality:1.4)
- Sampler: ‚ÄúDPM++ SDE Karras‚Äù is good
- Steps: forTest: 20ÔΩû24 ,illustration: 24ÔΩû50
- Clipskip: 1
- USE ‚Äúupscale latent space‚Äù
- Denoise strength: 0.45 (0.4~0.5)
If you use 0.7ÔΩû, the picture will change too much.

‚ñºPrompts

üñåWhen generating cute girls, try this negative prompt first. It avoids low quality, prevents blurring, avoids dull colors, and dictates Anime-like cute face modeling.

### AbyssOrangeMix_base (AOMb)

‚ñº?

The basic trick for this merged model is to incorporate a model that has learned more than 1m Instagram photos (mostly Japanese) or a photorealistic model like f222. The choice of base model here depends on the person. I chose AnythingV3 for versatility.

## Troubleshooting

1. blurred Images & clearly low quality output  
If the generated images are blurred or only clearly low quality output is produced, it is possible that the vae, etc. are not loaded properly. Try reloading the model/vae or restarting the WebUI/OS.

‚ñºNooooo, This models have troy virus. don't download.  
All models in this repository are secure. It is most likely that anti-virus software has detected them erroneously.  
However, the models with the .ckpt extension have the potential danger of executing arbitrary code.  
A safe model that is free from these dangers is the model with the .safetensors extension.
