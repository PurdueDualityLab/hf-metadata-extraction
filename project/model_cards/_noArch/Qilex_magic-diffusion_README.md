### Magic Diffusion

This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on scans of Magic: the Gathering card artworks.
Use the tokens **_mtg style_** in your prompts.


It does not have additional knowledge of Magic-specific terms.

**Characters rendered with the model:**

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("Qilex/magic-diffusion", torch_dtype=torch.half).to("cuda")
prompt = "mtg style Tony Stark, in a city"
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast(True):
    image = pipeline(prompt, num_inference_steps=40, guidance_scale=8, height = 512, width = 712, scheduler = "DDIM").images[0]
image.save(f"img.png")

```
You can try it out on the [Colab example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wlvbTnVxm3bfFwW793cEEVeOYtB0mRG3?usp=sharing), which should work on the free GPU tier.


This model was trained using the diffusers dreambooth training example script using prior-preservation loss and finetuning the text encoder on roughly 120 images in 8.000 steps.
