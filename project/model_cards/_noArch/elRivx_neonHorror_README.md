# neonHorror
This is a Stable Diffusion model about horror illustrations with a little bit of neon lights.
Some recomendations: the magic word for your prompts is neonHorror .In some times, you would put some prompts like:

request, in neonHorror style

or

an illustration of request, in neonHorror style

or

neonHorror, request

PS: you can replace 'request' with a person, character, etc.
