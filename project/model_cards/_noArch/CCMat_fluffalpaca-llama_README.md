# DreamBooth model for the fluffalpaca concept trained on the CCMat/db-aplaca dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the fluffalpaca concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of fluffalpaca llama**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `llama` images for the animal theme.<br>

### Training Hyperparemeters

## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('CCMat/fluffalpaca-llama-1078')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
