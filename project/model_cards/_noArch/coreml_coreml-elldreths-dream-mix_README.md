# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

# Note: This model does not have the [unet split into chunks](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-converting-models-to-core-ml).

# Elldreth's Dream Mix:
Source(s): [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/1254/elldreths-dream-mix)

This mixed model is a combination of some of my favorites. A little Pyros Model A mixed with a F111-sd14 diff and mixed into Anything.

What's it good at?

Portraits
Landscapes
Fantasy
Sci-Fi
Anime
Semi-realistic
Horror
It's an all-around easy-to-prompt general purpose model that cranks out some really nice images. No trigger words required. All models were scanned prior to mixing and totally safe.
