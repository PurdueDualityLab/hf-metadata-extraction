This repo is for testing the first Openjourney fine tuned model. 

It was trained over Stable Diffusion 1.5 with +60000 images, 4500 steps and 3 epochs.

So "mdjrny-v4 style" is not necessary anymore (yay!)

Things to check in this beta:
- Is the quality better that the [Dreambooth version](https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney)?
