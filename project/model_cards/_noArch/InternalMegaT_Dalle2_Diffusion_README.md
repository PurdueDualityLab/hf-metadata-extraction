#MODEL BY InternalMegaT

**_If you aren't getting results that Dalle2 would normally give you on a specific prompt, tell me in the community tab what prompt you are using._**

How to use: I'd recommend 768x768 or 1024x1024, at 40 steps and 7 CFG Scale, Euler A. Prompting can be how you would normal prompt using Dalle 2. A good default negative prompt would be "lowres, error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, out of frame, watermark, signature, deformed, ugly, mutilated, disfigured, text, extra limbs, face cut, head cut, extra fingers, extra arms, poorly drawn face, mutation, bad proportions, cropped head, malformed limbs, mutated hands, fused fingers, long neck"

Details - 1024x1024, v2-1 Base
