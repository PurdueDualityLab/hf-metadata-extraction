### Ghibli Diffusion

This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on images from modern anime feature films from Studio Ghibli.
Use the tokens **_ghibli style_** in your prompts for the effect.

#### Prompt and settings for the Strom Trooper:
**ghibli style (storm trooper) Negative prompt: (bad anatomy)**
_Steps: 20, Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 3450349066, Size: 512x704_

#### Prompt and settings for the VW Beetle:
**ghibli style VW beetle Negative prompt: soft blurry**
_Steps: 30, Sampler: Euler a, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 1529856912, Size: 704x512_

This model was trained using the diffusers based dreambooth training by ShivamShrirao using prior-preservation loss and the _train-text-encoder_ flag in 15.000 steps.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "nitrosocke/Ghibli-Diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "ghibli style magical princess with golden hair"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./magical_princess.png")
```
