# Model Details

## Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is/does. -->
ASR model built by Speech Lab, IIT Madras

- **Developed by:** More information needed
- **Shared by [Optional]:** More information needed
- **Model type:** Language model
- **Language(s) (NLP):** en
- **License:** apache-2.0
- **Parent Model:** More information needed
- **Resources for more information:** More information needed



# Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

## Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->
<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say "more info needed." -->




## Downstream Use [Optional]

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->
<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say "more info needed." -->
 



## Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->
<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say "more info needed." -->




# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.


## Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->





# Training Details

## Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Data Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

More information on training data needed


## Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

### Preprocessing

More information needed

### Speeds, Sizes, Times

<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->

More information needed
 
# Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Data Card if possible. -->

More information needed


### Factors

<!-- These are the things the evaluation is disaggregating by, e.g., subpopulations or domains. -->

More information needed

### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->

More information needed

## Results 

More information needed

# Model Examination

More information needed

# Environmental Impact

<!-- Total emissions (in grams of CO2eq) and additional considerations, such as electricity usage, go here. Edit the suggested text below accordingly -->

Carbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).
