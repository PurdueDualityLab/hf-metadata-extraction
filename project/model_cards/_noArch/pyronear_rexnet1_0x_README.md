# ReXNet-1.0x model

Pretrained on a dataset for wildfire binary classification (soon to be shared). The ReXNet architecture was introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00992.pdf).


## Model description

The core idea of the author is to add a customized Squeeze-Excitation layer in the residual blocks that will prevent channel redundancy.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

Python 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)/[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) are required to install PyroVision.

### Latest stable release

You can install the last stable release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyrovision/) as follows:

```shell
pip install pyrovision
```

or using [conda](https://anaconda.org/pyronear/pyrovision):

```shell
conda install -c pyronear pyrovision
```

### Developer mode

Alternatively, if you wish to use the latest features of the project that haven't made their way to a release yet, you can install the package from source *(install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) first)*:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pyronear/pyro-vision.git
pip install -e pyro-vision/.
```


## Usage instructions

```python
from PIL import Image
from torchvision.transforms import Compose, ConvertImageDtype, Normalize, PILToTensor, Resize
from torchvision.transforms.functional import InterpolationMode
from pyrovision.models import model_from_hf_hub

model = model_from_hf_hub("pyronear/rexnet1_0x").eval()

img = Image.open(path_to_an_image).convert("RGB")

# Preprocessing
config = model.default_cfg
transform = Compose([
    Resize(config['input_shape'][1:], interpolation=InterpolationMode.BILINEAR),
    PILToTensor(),
    ConvertImageDtype(torch.float32),
    Normalize(config['mean'], config['std'])
])

input_tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)

# Inference
with torch.inference_mode():
    output = model(input_tensor)
probs = output.squeeze(0).softmax(dim=0)
```
