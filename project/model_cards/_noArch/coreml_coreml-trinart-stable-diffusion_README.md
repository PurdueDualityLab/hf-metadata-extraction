# Core ML Converted Model:

  - This model was converted to Core ML for use on Apple Silicon devices. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion/wiki/How-to-convert-ckpt-files-to-Core-ML).<br>
  - Provide the model to an app such as [Mochi Diffusion](https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion) to generate images.<br>
  - `split_einsum` version is compatible with all compute unit options including Neural Engine.<br>

Stable Diffusion TrinArt/Trin-sama AI finetune v2
trinart_stable_diffusion is a SD model finetuned by about 40,000 assorted high resolution manga/anime-style pictures for 8 epochs. This is the same model running on Twitter bot @trinsama (https://twitter.com/trinsama)

# Please Note!
This model is NOT the 19.2M images Characters Model on TrinArt, but an improved version of the original Trin-sama Twitter bot model. This model is intended to retain the original SD's aesthetics as much as possible while nudging the model to anime/manga style.
