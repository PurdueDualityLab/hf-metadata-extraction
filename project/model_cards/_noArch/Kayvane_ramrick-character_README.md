# DreamBooth model for the ramrick concept (Rick from Rick & Morty) trained by Kayvane on the Kayvane/dreambooth-hackathon-rick-and-morty-images-2 dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the ramrick concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of ramrick character**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `character` images for the wildcard theme.


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('Kayvane/ramrick-character')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
