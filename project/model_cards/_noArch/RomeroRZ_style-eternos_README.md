#### Eternos - A surrealist / Minimalist model

(2.0 work in progress yay!)

With a base instances images generated from multiples surrealism art, some Dali touches and roman / greek architecture influences

the 704 version is more abstract and less style transferrable due to the higher resolution towards all regular styles.

Tips : use init image (even stretched) for non-standart resolution, it can help SD a lot to guide it :)
