Kalista was a state-of-the-art realism model that is extremely consistent in generating high quality outputs. This model is now archived and this repository will not be maintained.

All the example images provided are 100% raw and were generated in succession from one another. 

Kalista was meant to be a quick experiment on 'simulating' additional training steps by finding the mean values of multiple different checkpoints that were
trained on separate datasets.

More photo examples can be found in the images folder of this repository.
