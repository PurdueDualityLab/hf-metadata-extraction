### MoistMix V2
Based on SD1.5

A much improved version of my last, quite a different style, but sticking to the same theme as a "do anything" type of model. It LOVES artist prompts and they can change up the whole image dramatically.

For any questions or feedback: [Pixiv](https://pixiv.me/moistmix)

This model includes a CKPT and a SafeTensors filetype which you can use the same way as a CKPT, with (sometimes) increased load speed while avoiding pickles. I am including my VAE as well.
