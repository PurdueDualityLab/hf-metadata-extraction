# Welcome to MY MODEL!

Hi! Dreambooth model for me. Use it as you want and respect the license model.

## How do I use it?

The keyword for this model is **vitordeluccagrs**.
Try to use "*portrait of vitordeluccagrs shirtless reading a book in a chair, art by artgerm*". 
Be creative. Specify the faces features you want, hair style, the environment, if is a art, it's in which artist style? Want it realistic? Say it! And also say which ISO, camera, etc. Want to look like 500px and unsplash pictures? Say it too! Want it to look like Blade Runner? Say it. **Be creative**.

USE NEGATIVE PROMPT! Stable Diffusion works best if you use negative prompt. With negative prompt, you are saying what things you don't want in picture, like you know... extra fingers!.
