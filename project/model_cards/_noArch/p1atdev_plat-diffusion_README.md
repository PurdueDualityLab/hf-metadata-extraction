# Plat Diffusion v1.3.1

Plat Diffusion v1.3.1 is a latent model fine-tuned on [Waifu Diffusion v1.4 Anime Epoch 2](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4) with images from nijiãƒ»journey and some generative AI.

`.safetensors` file is [here](https://huggingface.co/p1atdev/pd-archive/tree/main).

[kl-f8-anime2.ckpt](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion-v1-4/blob/main/vae/kl-f8-anime2.ckpt) is recommended for VAE.
