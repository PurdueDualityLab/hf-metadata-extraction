## Model Description

These are model weights originally provided by the authors of the paper [Learning Audio-Visual Speech Representation by Masked Multimodal Cluster Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02184.pdf).

Video recordings of speech contain correlated audio and visual information, providing a strong signal for speech representation learning from the speakerâ€™s lip
movements and the produced sound. 

Audio-Visual Hidden Unit BERT (AV-HuBERT), a self-supervised representation learning framework for audio-visual speech, which masks multi-stream video input and predicts automatically discovered and iteratively refined multimodal hidden units. AV-HuBERT
learns powerful audio-visual speech representation benefiting both lip-reading and automatic speech recognition.

## Datasets
The authors trained the model on LRS3 with 433 hours of transcribed English videos and English portion of VoxCeleb2, which amounts to 1,326 hours
