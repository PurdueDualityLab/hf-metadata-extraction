# MAXIM pre-trained on RealBlur-J for image deblurring 

MAXIM model pre-trained for image deblurring. It was introduced in the paper [MAXIM: Multi-Axis MLP for Image Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02973) by Zhengzhong Tu, Hossein Talebi, Han Zhang, Feng Yang, Peyman Milanfar, Alan Bovik, Yinxiao Li and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/google-research/maxim). 

Disclaimer: The team releasing MAXIM did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

MAXIM introduces a shared MLP-based backbone for different image processing tasks such as image deblurring, deraining, denoising, dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and retouching. The following figure depicts the main components of MAXIM:

## Training procedure and results

The authors didn't release the training code. For more details on how the model was trained, refer to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02973). 

As per the [table](https://github.com/google-research/maxim#results-and-pre-trained-models), the model achieves a PSNR of 32.84 and an SSIM of 0.935. 

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for image deblurring tasks. 

The model is [officially released in JAX](https://github.com/google-research/maxim). It was ported to TensorFlow in [this repository](https://github.com/sayakpaul/maxim-tf). 

### How to use

Here is how to use this model:

```python
from huggingface_hub import from_pretrained_keras
from PIL import Image

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import requests

url = "https://github.com/sayakpaul/maxim-tf/raw/main/images/Deblurring/input/1fromGOPR0950.png"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
image = np.array(image)
image = tf.convert_to_tensor(image)
image = tf.image.resize(image, (256, 256))

model = from_pretrained_keras("google/maxim-s3-deblurring-realblur-j")
predictions = model.predict(tf.expand_dims(image, 0))
```

For a more elaborate prediction pipeline, refer to [this Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/maxim-tf/blob/main/notebooks/inference-dynamic-resize.ipynb).
