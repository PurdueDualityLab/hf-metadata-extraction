# DreamBooth model for the itgted concept trained by Yuheng111.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the itgted concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of itgted slipper**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a sneaker design auxiliary model trained on a stable diffusion model, Combining the traditional form of sneakers with the integration and layered features of 3D printingï¼Œ
for the Hugging Face DreamBooth Hackathon, from the HF CN Community, 
corporated with the HeyWhale.


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('Yuheng111/3d-print-style-snkr-gererate')
image = pipeline().images[0]
