# VoxLingua107 ECAPA-TDNN Spoken Language Identification Model

## Model description

This is a spoken language recognition model trained on the VoxLingua107 dataset using SpeechBrain.
The model uses the ECAPA-TDNN architecture that has previously been used for speaker recognition. However, it uses
more fully connected hidden layers after the embedding layer, and cross-entropy loss was used for training. 
We observed that this improved the performance of extracted utterance embeddings for downstream tasks.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *classify_file* if needed.

The model can classify a speech utterance according to the language spoken.
It covers 107 different languages (

## Intended uses & limitations

The model has two uses:

  - use 'as is' for spoken language recognition
  - use as an utterance-level feature (embedding) extractor, for creating a dedicated language ID model on your own data
  
The model is trained on automatically collected YouTube data. For more 
information about the dataset, see [here](http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/voxlingua107/).


#### How to use

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier
language_id = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/lang-id-voxlingua107-ecapa", savedir="tmp")
# Download Thai language sample from Omniglot and cvert to suitable form

# The scores in the prediction[0] tensor can be interpreted as log-likelihoods that
# the given utterance belongs to the given language (i.e., the larger the better)
# The linear-scale likelihood can be retrieved using the following:
print(prediction[1].exp())
#  tensor([0.9850])
# The identified language ISO code is given in prediction[3]
print(prediction[3])
#  ['th: Thai']
  
# Alternatively, use the utterance embedding extractor:
emb =  language_id.encode_batch(signal)
print(emb.shape)
# torch.Size([1, 1, 256])
```
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *classify_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *encode_batch* and *classify_batch*.

#### Limitations and bias

Since the model is trained on VoxLingua107, it has many limitations and biases, some of which are:

 - Probably it's accuracy on smaller languages  is quite limited
 - Probably it works worse on female speech than male speech (because YouTube data includes much more male speech)
 - Based on subjective experiments, it doesn't work well on speech with a foreign accent
 - Probably it doesn't work well on children's speech and on persons with speech disorders


## Training data

The model is trained on [VoxLingua107](http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/voxlingua107/).

VoxLingua107 is a speech dataset for training spoken language identification models. 
The dataset consists of short speech segments automatically extracted from YouTube videos and labeled according the language of the video title and description, with some post-processing steps to filter out false positives.

VoxLingua107 contains data for 107 languages. The total amount of speech in the training set is 6628 hours. 
The average amount of data per language is 62 hours. However, the real amount per language varies a lot. There is also a seperate development set containing 1609 speech segments from 33 languages, validated by at least two volunteers to really contain the given language.

## Training procedure

See the [SpeechBrain recipe](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/voxlingua107/recipes/VoxLingua107/lang_id).

## Evaluation results

Error rate: 6.7% on the VoxLingua107 development dataset
