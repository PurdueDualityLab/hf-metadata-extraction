### Original-Character---Cyclps Dreambooth model trained by alvdansen with [TheLastBen's fast-DreamBooth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb) notebook

This character was designed with 1500 steps and 12 images. She is a part of a longer character study being done by Archimedes Institute ( http://archimedes.institute.com ) to create a clearer path for artists interested in training original characters into a dreambooth finetune.

Test the concept via A1111 Colab [fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)
Or you can run your new concept via `diffusers` [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb)
