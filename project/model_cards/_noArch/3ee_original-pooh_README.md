# üêª Original Pooh Diffusion

Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model, based of ```F222```, trained with pictures illustrated by ```E. H. Shepard``` from the book "Winnie-the-Pooh", by A. A. Milne, originally published in Canada by McClelland & Stewart, Ltd., 1926. Released into the public domain on January 3, 2022.

## üß® Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

Export the model:
- [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx)
- [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps)
- [FLAX/JAX](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion_jax)

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "3ee/original-pooh"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "original pooh sneaking into a bee nest"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./pooh_pooh.png")
```
