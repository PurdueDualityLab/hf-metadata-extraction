learning_rate 2.5e-6, training with a6000x1, because I am too busy recently, I should not be able to actively do it, and the funds are slightly insufficient
,Forget it, I'm overtraining, take it as an interesting model,(Warning: above 768x832 is recommended, I found that the results below seem to be less than ideal)


Will be uploading actively in the near future
