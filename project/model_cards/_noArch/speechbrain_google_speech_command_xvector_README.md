# Command Recognition with xvector embeddings on Google Speech Commands

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform command recognition with SpeechBrain using a model pretrained on Google Speech Commands.
You can download the dataset [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands)
The dataset provides small training, validation, and test sets useful for detecting single keywords in short audio clips. The provided system can recognize the following 12 keywords:
```
'yes', 'no', 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'on', 'off', 'stop', 'go', 'unknown', 'silence'
```

For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The given model performance on the test set is:

| Release | Accuracy(%) 
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| 06-02-21 | 98.14 | 


## Pipeline description
This system is composed of a TDNN model coupled with statistical pooling. A classifier, trained with Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, is applied on top of that.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *classify_file* if needed.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform Command Recognition

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier
classifier = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/google_speech_command_xvector", savedir="pretrained_models/google_speech_command_xvector")
out_prob, score, index, text_lab = classifier.classify_file('speechbrain/google_speech_command_xvector/yes.wav')
print(text_lab)
out_prob, score, index, text_lab = classifier.classify_file('speechbrain/google_speech_command_xvector/stop.wav')
print(text_lab)
```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (b7ff9dc4).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd recipes/Google-speech-commands
python train.py hparams/xvect.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BKwtr1mBRICRe56PcQk2sCFq63Lsvdpc?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
