# DreamBooth model for the astronomy concept trained by Dhruv Singal on a dataset of hedgehog images from Kaggle[link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therealoise/hedgehogs-and-porcupines).

This is a Stable Diffusion 2.1 model fine-tuned on the hedgehog concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: a photo of cute hhog hedgehog eating cookies****

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!
