### Nitro Diffusion

Welcome to Nitro Diffusion - the first Multi-Style Model trained from scratch! This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on three artstyles simultaniously while keeping each style separate from the others. This allows for high control of mixing, weighting and single style use.
Use the tokens **_archer style, arcane style or modern disney style_** in your prompts for the effect. You can also use more than one for a mixed style like in the examples down below:

## Gradio

We support a [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) Web UI to run Nitro-Diffusion:

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "nitrosocke/nitro-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "archer arcane style magical princess with golden hair"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./magical_princess.png")
```

1. You can't use the model to deliberately produce nor share illegal or harmful outputs or content 
2. The authors claims no rights on the outputs you generate, you are free to use them and are accountable for their use which must not go against the provisions set in the license
3. You may re-distribute the weights and use the model commercially and/or as a service.
