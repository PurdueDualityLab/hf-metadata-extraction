This dataset contains the [**google/rembert**](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/rembert.html) model weights according to my team's experimentation strategy during the [**chaii - Hindi and Tamil Question Answering**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering) competition. They are listed below with their corresponding public LB score:-
