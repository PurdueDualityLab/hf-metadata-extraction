# SoundChoice: Grapheme-to-Phoneme Models with Semantic Disambiguation

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform English grapheme-to-phoneme conversion with a pretrained SoundChoice G2P model using SpeechBrain. It is trained on LibriG2P training data derived from [LibriSpeech Alignments](https://zenodo.org/record/2619474#.YuCdaC8r1ZF) and [Google Wikipedia](https://github.com/google/WikipediaHomographData)


## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command (local installation):

```bash
pip install speechbrain
pip install transformers
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

## Perform G2P Conversion

Please follow the example below to perform grapheme-to-phoneme conversion with a high-level wrapper.

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import GraphemeToPhoneme
g2p = GraphemeToPhoneme.from_hparams("speechbrain/soundchoice-g2p")
text = "To be or not to be, that is the question"
phonemes = g2p(text)
```

Given below is the expected output
```python
>>> phonemes
['T', 'UW', ' ', 'B', 'IY', ' ', 'AO', 'R', ' ', 'N', 'AA', 'T', ' ', 'T', 'UW', ' ', 'B', 'IY', ' ', 'DH', 'AE', 'T', ' ', 'IH', 'Z', ' ', 'DH', 'AH', ' ', 'K', 'W', 'EH', 'S', 'CH', 'AH', 'N']
```

To perform G2P conversion on a batch of text, pass
an array of strings to the interface:

```python
items = [
    "All's Well That Ends Well",
    "The Merchant of Venice",
    "The Two Gentlemen of Verona",
    "The Comedy of Errors"
]
transcriptions = g2p(items)
```

Given below is the expected output:

```python
>>> transcriptions
[['AO', 'L', 'Z', ' ', 'W', 'EH', 'L', ' ', 'DH', 'AE', 'T', ' ', 'EH', 'N', 'D', 'Z', ' ', 'W', 'EH', 'L'], ['DH', 'AH', ' ', 'M', 'ER', 'CH', 'AH', 'N', 'T', ' ', 'AH', 'V', ' ', 'V', 'EH', 'N', 'AH', 'S'], ['DH', 'AH', ' ', 'T', 'UW', ' ', 'JH', 'EH', 'N', 'T', 'AH', 'L', 'M', 'IH', 'N', ' ', 'AH', 'V', ' ', 'V', 'ER', 'OW', 'N', 'AH'], ['DH', 'AH', ' ', 'K', 'AA', 'M', 'AH', 'D', 'IY', ' ', 'AH', 'V', ' ', 'EH', 'R', 'ER', 'Z']]
```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (aa018540).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd recipes/LibriSpeech/G2P
python train.py hparams/hparams_g2p_rnn.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

Adjust hyperparameters as needed by passing additional arguments.
