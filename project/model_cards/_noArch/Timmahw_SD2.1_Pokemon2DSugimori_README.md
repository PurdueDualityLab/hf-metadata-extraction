My kids love this. Stable Diffusion 2.1 model trained, via Dreambooth, for generations 1-8 of Pokemon "Sugimori" designs. 768x768 for best results. Good for mixing species and types, adequate at applying species and types to non-pokemon terms (like fire horse).

Added terms include GMAX, Mega, (PokemonName), (PokemonType). GMAX works well as a style. Recommend adding "mega" and "gmax" to negative prompt unless you're into that.

Prompt: dragon armored (eevee), wings, (fire claws), smoke, cityscape

Negative: pixelated, distorted
