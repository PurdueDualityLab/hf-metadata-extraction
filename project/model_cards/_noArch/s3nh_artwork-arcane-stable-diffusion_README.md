### Arcane based Artwork Diffusion Model

I present you fine tuned model of stable-diffusion-v1-5, which heavily based of 
work of great artworks from Arcane.
Use the tokens **_arcane style_** in your prompts for the effect.

Model was trained using the diffusers library, which based on Dreambooth implementation. 
Training steps included: 

- prior preservation loss
- train-text-encoder fine tuning 

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
#!pip install diffusers transformers scipy torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
model_id = "s3nh/artwork-arcane-stable-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
prompt = "Rain forest, arcane style"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("./example_output.png")
```
