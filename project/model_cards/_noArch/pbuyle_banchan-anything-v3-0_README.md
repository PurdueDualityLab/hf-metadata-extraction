# Banano Chan - Anything v3.0 (banchan-anything-v3.0)


A potassium rich latent diffusion model. [Anything V3.0](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0) trained to the likeness of [Banano Chan](https://twitter.com/Banano_Chan/). The digital waifu embodiment of [Banano](https://www.banano.cc), a feeless and super fast meme cryptocurrency.

This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

e.g. `banchan, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden`

A [detailed usage guide](https://huggingface.co/Banano/banchan-anything-v3-0/blob/main/doc/README.md) is also available if you are new to Stable Diffusion, image generation and prompting.
