# üéÅ Ornamental Santa Diffusion

When you close your eyes and think about what Santa would look like - he‚Äôs different for everyone and the hope is this model captures that sense of wonder Santa Claus brought us when we were children.

Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model, based of ```F222```, trained with pictures from over two hundred Santa Claus themed ornaments and knick-knacks.

![Detailed Samples](https://huggingface.co/3ee/ornamental-santa/resolve/main/booth1.png)

## Model Usage

‚ú® Use the tokens **_orna santa_** in your prompts to activate the model.

The model was trained on a wide variety of different ornaments, we encourage you to try different variations of vivid prompts.  Below are examples of the model's output.

## üé® Using or building a merged model

Merging models is similar to mixing paint.  By adding different models and using multiplers, you can further fine tune models with different styles.

![Detailed Samples](https://huggingface.co/3ee/ornamental-santa/resolve/main/booth_merged1.png)

 **Add more depth: Use the merged model that we've already compiled**:

- Download ```ornasanta_AnythingV3.0_fp16_0.3.ckpt``` located https://huggingface.co/3ee/ornamental-santa/tree/main
- Add ```ornasanta_AnythingV3.0_fp16_0.3.ckpt``` to your Stable Diffusion models.
- Activate merged models with the prompt table below.

| Model      | Prompts                                                                                                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ornasanta  | orna santa                                                                                                                 |
| AnythingV3 | 1girl, white hair, golden eyes, beautiful eyes, detail, flower meadow, cumulonimbus clouds, lighting, detailed sky, garden |
| Mo Di      | modern disney style                                                                                                        |

This model is merged with [Anythingv3](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0) as the secondary model and [Mo Di Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/mo-di-diffusion) as the tertiary model.

**Settings to merge these models youself**

You can also merge these models yourself.  See the table below:

| Model      | Weight | Prompts             | Type       |
|------------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| ornasanta  | 0.3    | orna santa          | Primary    |
| AnythingV3 | 0.3    | 1man                | Secondary  |
| Mo Di      | 0.3    | modern disney style | tertiary   |
