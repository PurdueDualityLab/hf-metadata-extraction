# SepFormer trained on WSJ0-2Mix

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform audio source separation with a [SepFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154v2) 
model, implemented with SpeechBrain, and pretrained on WSJ0-2Mix dataset. For a better experience we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The model performance is 22.4 dB on the test set of WSJ0-2Mix dataset.

| Release | Test-Set SI-SNRi | Test-Set SDRi |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| 09-03-21 | 22.4dB | 22.6dB |

You can listen to example results obtained on the test set of WSJ0-2/3Mix through [here](https://sourceseparationresearch.com/static/sepformer_example_results/sepformer_results.html). 


## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform source separation on your own audio file
```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import SepformerSeparation as separator
import torchaudio

model = separator.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/sepformer-wsj02mix", savedir='pretrained_models/sepformer-wsj02mix')

# for custom file, change path
est_sources = model.separate_file(path='speechbrain/sepformer-wsj02mix/test_mixture.wav') 

torchaudio.save("source1hat.wav", est_sources[:, :, 0].detach().cpu(), 8000)
torchaudio.save("source2hat.wav", est_sources[:, :, 1].detach().cpu(), 8000)
```

The system expects input recordings sampled at 8kHz (single channel).
If your signal has a different sample rate, resample it (e.g, using torchaudio or sox) before using the interface.

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (fc2eabb7).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd  recipes/WSJ0Mix/separation
python train.py hparams/sepformer.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cON-eqtKv_NYnJhaE9VjLT_e2ybn-O7u?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
