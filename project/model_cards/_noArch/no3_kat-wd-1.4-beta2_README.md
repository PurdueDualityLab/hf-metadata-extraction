### a Better model is out, Go to https://huggingface.co/no3/kat-at3-beta1
### kat from [Flipon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285020/Flipon/) on [WD](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion) via Dreambooth
#### model by no3
This your waifu-diffusion v1.4 model fine-tuned kat concept taught to waifu-diffusion v1.4 with Dreambooth.
It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **sks kaatt**

You can also train your own concepts and upload them to the library by using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_training.ipynb).
And you can run your new concept via `diffusers`: [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb), [Spaces with the Public Concepts loaded](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sd-dreambooth-library/stable-diffusion-dreambooth-concepts).
### note
If you want to to use in UI like [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) or any UI that's uses .ckpt files just download one or more file from here for your convenience.
