SlateModel is a grey model project built upon Stable Diffusion 2.1 768x.

<b>Imporatant: Whether choosing ckpt or safetensors version, you will require the yaml inference file for webui use.<br/>
Black Images?:</b> you must use either the <i>--no-half</i> switch in webui startup, or, use <i>--xformers</i> (xformers should be much faster).

This model is provided as part of the GreyModel project. 

The GreyModel is a community driven project to attempt to make a Stable Diffusion model that is trained upon the light and the dark that makes up humanity.

The model is powered by community effort to gather, caption, and enchance data.
