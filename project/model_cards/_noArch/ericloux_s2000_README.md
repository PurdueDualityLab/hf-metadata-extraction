### S2000 Dreambooth model trained by ericloux with [TheLastBen's fast-DreamBooth](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb) notebook


Test the concept via A1111 Colab [fast-Colab-A1111](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion/blob/main/fast_stable_diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.ipynb)
Or you can run your new concept via `diffusers` [Colab Notebook for Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_dreambooth_inference.ipynb)

This is a model I (over)trained on the VOGELE SUPER 2000-3i paver, with "S2000 bulldozer" as the prompt. Although it's a paver, I get the most cohesive results when using "bulldozer" over "paver".

Sample pictures of this concept:
