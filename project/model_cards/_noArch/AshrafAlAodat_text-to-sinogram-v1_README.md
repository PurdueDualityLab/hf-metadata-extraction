# Text-To-Sinogram

is an app for generation of sinogram with stable diffusion.

* Model checkpoint: https://huggingface.co/AshrafAlAodat/text-to-sinogram-v1

This repository contains the model files, including:

 * a diffusers formated library
 * a compiled checkpoint file
 * a traced unet for improved inference speed

## Model V1

It is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating sinogram images given any text input. These sinograms can be reconstructed back to the original image.

The model was created by [Ashraf Al-Aodat](https://github.com/Ashraf-Al-Aodat) as a proof of concept.

You can use the model directly.

The model was created by fine-tuning the **Stable-Diffusion-v1-5** checkpoint. Read about Stable Diffusion here [ðŸ¤—'s Stable Diffusion blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion).

### Model Details
- **Developed by:** Ashraf Al-Aodat
- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-image generation model
- **Language(s):** English
- **License:** [The CreativeML OpenRAIL M license](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) is an [Open RAIL M license](https://www.licenses.ai/blog/2022/8/18/naming-convention-of-responsible-ai-licenses), adapted from the work that [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) and [the RAIL Initiative](https://www.licenses.ai/) are jointly carrying in the area of responsible AI licensing. See also [the article about the BLOOM Open RAIL license](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license) on which our license is based.
- **Model Description:** This is a model that can be used to generate and modify images based on text prompts. It is a [Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) that uses a fixed, pretrained text encoder ([CLIP ViT-L/14](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)) as suggested in the [Imagen paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487).

### Direct Use 
The model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and
tasks include

- Generation of artworks, and use in creative processes.
- Applications in educational or creative tools.
- Research on generative models.

### Datasets
The modeal was trained on the [sinograms](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AshrafAlAodat/sinograms) dataset.

### Fine Tuning

Check out the [diffusers training examples](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/overview) from Hugging Face. Fine tuning requires a dataset of sinogram images of objects, with associated text describing them. Note that the CLIP encoder is able to understand and connect many words even if they never appear in the dataset. It is also possible to use a [dreambooth](https://huggingface.co/blog/dreambooth) method to get custom styles.
