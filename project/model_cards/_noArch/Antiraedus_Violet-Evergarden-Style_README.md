# DreamBooth model for the vioeva concept trained by Antiraedus on the Antiraedus/Violet-Evergarden dataset.
I FORGOT IT WAS GRAYSCALED

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the vioeva concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of a girl in vioeva style**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!
