# BG-VisualNovel-v03

A prototype project of generating Visual Novel backgrounds for game developers/artists. This model is intended to produce visual novel backgrounds with just a few prompts. Version 3 is based on Anything-V3.

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "vinesmsuic/bg-visualnovel-v03"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a classroom"
image = pipe(prompt, height=512, width=512).images[0]
# ^ alternatively you can use for height=1920, width=1080 if you have enough CUDA memory
# make sure both height and width are divisible by 8
image.save("./classroom.png")

prompt = "a hospital building, two trees"
image = pipe(prompt, height=512, width=512).images[0]

image.save("./hospital.png")

prompt = "a street at night with nobody around"
image = pipe(prompt, height=512, width=512).images[0]

image.save("./nightstreet.png")
```
