# DreamBooth model for the dashdash concept trained by quincyqiang.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the dashdash concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of dashdash rabit**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `rabit` images for the wildcard theme, 
for the Hugging Face DreamBooth Hackathon, from the HF CN Community, 
corporated with the HeyWhale.


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('quincyqiang/dashdash-rabit-heywhale')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
