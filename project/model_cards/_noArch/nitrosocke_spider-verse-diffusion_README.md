**Spider-Verse Diffusion**

This is the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on movie stills from Sony's Into the Spider-Verse.
Use the tokens **_spiderverse style_** in your prompts for the effect.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
#!pip install diffusers transformers scipy torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "nitrosocke/spider-verse-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a magical princess with golden hair, spiderverse style"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./magical_princess.png")
```

This model was trained using the diffusers based dreambooth training and prior-preservation loss in 3.000 steps.
