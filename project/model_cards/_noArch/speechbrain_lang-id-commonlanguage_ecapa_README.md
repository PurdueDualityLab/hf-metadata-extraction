# Language Identification from Speech Recordings with ECAPA embeddings on CommonLanguage

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform language identification from speech recordings with SpeechBrain.
The system uses a model pretrained on the CommonLanguage dataset (45 languages).
You can download the dataset [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5036977#.YNzDbXVKg5k)
The provided system can recognize the following 45 languages from short speech recordings:

```
Arabic, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Chinese_China, Chinese_Hongkong, Chinese_Taiwan, Chuvash, Czech, Dhivehi, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, French, Frisian, Georgian, German, Greek, Hakha_Chin, Indonesian, Interlingua, Italian, Japanese, Kabyle, Kinyarwanda, Kyrgyz, Latvian, Maltese, Mongolian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Romansh_Sursilvan, Russian, Sakha, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Tatar, Turkish, Ukrainian, Welsh
```

For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). The given model performance on the test set is:

| Release | Accuracy (%)
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| 30-06-21 | 85.0 | 


## Pipeline description
This system is composed of an ECAPA model coupled with statistical pooling. A classifier, trained with Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, is applied on top of that.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *classify_file* if needed. Make sure your input tensor is compliant with the expected sampling rate if you use *encode_batch* and *classify_batch*.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Perform Language  Identification from Speech Recordings

```python
import torchaudio
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier
classifier = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/lang-id-commonlanguage_ecapa", savedir="pretrained_models/lang-id-commonlanguage_ecapa")
# Italian Example
out_prob, score, index, text_lab = classifier.classify_file('speechbrain/lang-id-commonlanguage_ecapa/example-it.wav')
print(text_lab)

# French Example
out_prob, score, index, text_lab = classifier.classify_file('speechbrain/lang-id-commonlanguage_ecapa/example-fr.wav')
print(text_lab)
```

### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (a02f860e).
To train it from scratch follow these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd recipes/CommonLanguage/lang_id
python train.py hparams/train_ecapa_tdnn.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sD2u0MhSmJlx_3RRgwsYzevX81RM8-WE?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
