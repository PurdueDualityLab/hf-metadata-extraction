# DreamBooth model for the rblx concept trained by adamwatters on the adamwatters/roblox-guy dataset.

## Description

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on images of my specific customized Roblox avatar. Idea is: maybe it would be fun for Roblox players to make images of their avatars in different settings.

It can be used by modifying the instance_prompt: a photo of rblx character

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!
