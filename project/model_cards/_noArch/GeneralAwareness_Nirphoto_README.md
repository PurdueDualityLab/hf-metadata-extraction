Textual Inversion Embedding by General Awareness For SD 2.x trained on 768x768 images from various sources.

Install by downloading the .pt embedding, and put it in the \embeddings folder.

This embedding was made to simulate NIR (Near Infrared) photography (that other worldly snowy look), and it does some wild things if used as a negative prompt as well.
