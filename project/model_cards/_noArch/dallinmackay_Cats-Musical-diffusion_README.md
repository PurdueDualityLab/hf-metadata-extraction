### Cats the Musical Diffusion

This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model (based on v1.5) trained on screenshots from the film **_Cats (2019)_**. Use the token **_ctsmscl_** at the BEGINNING of your prompts to use the style (e.g., "ctsmscl, thanos"). This model works best with the Euler sampler (NOT Euler_a). It will take some experimenting to get good results, my sample images are heavily cherry-picked this time (~10% success rate for likeness of real people). Use (prompt) [weighting] to balance the style with the character.

The model you didn't ask for, and didn't know you needed. Trained on the horribly uncanny musical, Cats, which was based on an even more horrible previous version, which was based on a horrible live stage musical. It has endured all opposition, and who am I to stand in it's way? This model is inevitable.

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().
