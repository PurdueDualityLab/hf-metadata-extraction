# DreamBooth model for the fgreeneruins concept trained on the CCMat/db-forest-ruins dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the fgreeneruins concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of fgreeneruins ruins**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `ruins` images for the landscape theme.<br>
Concept: **fgreeneruins** : forest ruins, greenery ruins<br>
Pretrained Model: [prompthero/openjourney](https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney)<br>
Learning rate: 2e-6<br>


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('CCMat/fgreeneruins-ruins-mdj')
image = pipeline().images[0]
image
```
