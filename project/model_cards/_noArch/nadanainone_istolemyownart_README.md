Trained Dreambooth model using all my own art currently uploaded to my Tumblr (https://nadanainone.tumblr.com/, link only for reference, imagine plugging your own work for clout l m a o) and drawn over the course of around 10 years. The results are an inconsistent mess of half animu, half cartoony and a complete artistic downgrade over using literally any other model. Can be massively improved by adding real artists to your prompts.

I love this model and the tech btw. Enjoy.
