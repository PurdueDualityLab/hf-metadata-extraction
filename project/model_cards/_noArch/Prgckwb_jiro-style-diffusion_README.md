# DreamBooth model for the jirostyle concept trained by Prgckwb on the Prgckwb/jiro-style-ramen dataset.

This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on the jirostyle concept with DreamBooth. It can be used by modifying the `instance_prompt`: **a photo of jirostyle ramen noodles**

This model was created as part of the DreamBooth Hackathon ðŸ”¥. Visit the [organisation page](https://huggingface.co/dreambooth-hackathon) for instructions on how to take part!

## Description


This is a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on `ramen noodles` images for the food theme.


## Usage

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained('Prgckwb/JiroStyle-ramen')
prompt = "a photo of jirostyle ramen noodles"

image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
```
