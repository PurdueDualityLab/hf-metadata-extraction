# Small conformer (13M parameters) for LibriSpeech (with Transformer LM)

This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform automatic speech
recognition from an end-to-end system pretrained on LibriSpeech (EN) within
SpeechBrain. For a better experience, we encourage you to learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io). 
The performance of the model is the following:

| Release | Test clean WER | Test other WER | GPUs |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|
| 24-03-22 | 2.49 | 6.03 | 1xV100 32GB |

## Pipeline description

This ASR system is composed of 3 different but linked blocks:
- Tokenizer (unigram) that transforms words into subword units and trained with
the train transcriptions of LibriSpeech.
- Neural language model (Transformer LM) trained on the full 10M words dataset.
- Acoustic model made of a small conformer encoder and a joint decoder with CTC +
transformer. Hence, the decoding also incorporates the CTC probabilities.

The system is trained with recordings sampled at 16kHz (single channel).
The code will automatically normalize your audio (i.e., resampling + mono channel selection) when calling *transcribe_file* if needed.

## Install SpeechBrain

First of all, please install SpeechBrain with the following command:

```
pip install speechbrain
```

Please notice that we encourage you to read our tutorials and learn more about
[SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io).

### Transcribing your own audio files (in English)

```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderDecoderASR

asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/asr-conformersmall-transformerlm-librispeech", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-conformersmall-transformerlm-librispeech")
asr_model.transcribe_file("speechbrain/asr-conformersmall-transformerlm-librispeech/example.wav")

```
### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

## Parallel Inference on a Batch
Please, [see this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hX5ZI9S4jHIjahFCZnhwwQmFoGAi3tmu?usp=sharing) to figure out how to transcribe in parallel a batch of input sentences using a pre-trained model.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (Commit hash: 'f73fcc35').
To train it from scratch follow these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```bash
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```bash
cd recipes/LibriSpeech/ASR/transformer
python train.py hparams/conformer_small.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

You can find our training results (models, logs, etc) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I4qntoodHCcj1JNbDrfwFHYcLyu1S5-l?usp=sharing).

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
