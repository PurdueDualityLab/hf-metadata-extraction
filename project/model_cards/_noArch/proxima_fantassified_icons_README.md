# about

- this was made with SD 1.4 
- generates icons inspired by fantasy games with mostly plain backgrounds, as seen [here](https://huggingface.co/proxima/fantassified_icons/blob/main/comparisons/euler_a_steps_vs_scale.jpg)
- struggles with things that are not fantasy-ish/not in the dataset, like sunglasses. best with simple stuff like shields and potions
- artist styles give mixed results. in any case they're more likely to show up when placed at the front of the prompt
- prompt tokens are: **fantassified icon**
- check the [PDF](https://huggingface.co/proxima/fantassified_icons/blob/main/fantassified_icons_v1_handbook.pdf) for prompt structure details, ideal settings, post processing tips, etc
- [comparisons folder](https://huggingface.co/proxima/fantassified_icons/tree/main/comparisons) has some steps/cfg_scale plots and raw examples
