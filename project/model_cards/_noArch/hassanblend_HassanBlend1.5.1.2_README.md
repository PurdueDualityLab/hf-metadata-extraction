# HassanBlend1.5 - fantasy.ai
Fantasy.ai is the official and exclusive hosted AI generation platform that holds a commercial use license for HassanBlend, you can use their service at https://Fantasy.ai/

I am hassan, I created HassansBlend, the latest version currently is 1.5.1.2 I continue to iterate and improve on this model over time. Feel free to check out our discord or rentry page for more examples with prompts and outputs generated.

This blend is finetuned over SD1.5 with thousands of images included in the dataset it was trained with. Along with that there are some minor merges added in just to soften it up and increase the creativity. 
I have also some custom created content such as enhancement hypernetworks/embeddings etc for patreons or KoFi subscribers only on my pages below
