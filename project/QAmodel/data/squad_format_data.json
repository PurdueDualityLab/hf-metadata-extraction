Training took about 9 days.\n- As training data we used the latest German Wikipedia dump (6GB of raw txt files), the OpenLegalData dump (2.4 GB) and news articles (3.6 GB).\n- We cleaned the data dumps with tailored scripts and segmented sentences with spacy v2.1. To create tensorflow records we used the recommended sentencepiece library for creating the word piece vocabulary and tensorflow scripts to convert the text to data usable by BERT.\n\n\nSee  for more details\n\n## Hyperparameters\n\n```\nbatch_size = 1024\nn_steps = 810_000\nmax_seq_len = 128 (and 512 later)\nlearning_rate = 1e-4\nlr_schedule = LinearWarmup\nnum_warmup_steps = 10_000\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nDuring training we monitored the loss and evaluated different model checkpoints on the following German datasets:\n\n- germEval18Fine: Macro f1 score for multiclass sentiment classification\n- germEval18coarse: Macro f1 score for binary sentiment classification\n- germEval14: Seq f1 score for NER (file names deuutf.\\*)\n- CONLL03: Seq f1 score for NER\n- 10kGNAD: Accuracy for document classification\n\nEven without thorough hyperparameter tuning, we observed quite stable learning especially for our German model. Multiple restarts with different seeds produced quite similar results.\n  \n![performancetable](  \n\nWe further evaluated different points during the 9 days of pre-training and were astonished how fast the model converges to the maximally reachable performance. We ran all 5 downstream tasks on 7 different model checkpoints - taken at 0 up to 840k training steps (x-axis in figure below). Most checkpoints are taken from early training where we expected most performance changes. Surprisingly, even a randomly initialized BERT can be trained only on labeled downstream datasets and reach good performance (blue line, GermEval 2018 Coarse task, 795 kB trainset size).\n\n![checkpointseval](  \n\n## Authors\n- Branden Chan: `branden.chan [at] deepset.ai`\n- Timo MÃ¶ller: `timo.moeller [at] deepset.ai`\n- Malte Pietsch: `malte.pietsch [at] deepset.ai`\n- Tanay Soni: `tanay.soni [at] deepset.ai`\n\n## About us\n![deepset logo](\n\nWe bring NLP to the industry via open source!  \nOur focus: Industry specific language models & large scale QA systems.  \n  \nSome of our work: \n- [German BERT (aka \"bert-base-german-cased\")](\n- [FARM](\n- [Haystack](\n\nGet in touch:\n[Twitter](  [Website](  \n",

The model is a causal (unidirectional) transformer pre-trained using language modeling on a large corpus with long range dependencies.\n\n- **Developed by:** Alec Radford, Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans, Ilya Sutskever.

You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we\nset a seed for reproducibility:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='openai-gpt')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"Hello, I'm a language model,\", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': \"Hello, I'm a language model,'he said, when i was finished.'ah well,'said the man,'that's\"},\n {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\\'m a language model, \" she said. \\n she reached the bottom of the shaft and leaned a little further out. it was'},\n {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\\'m a language model, \" she laughed. \" we call that a\\'white girl.\\'or as we are called by the'},\n {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\\'m a language model, \" said mr pin. \" an\\'the ones with the funny hats don\\'t. \" the rest of'},\n {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\\'m a language model, was\\'ere \\'bout to do some more dancin \\', \" he said, then his voice lowered to'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer, OpenAIGPTModel\nimport torch\n\ntokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"openai-gpt\")\nmodel = OpenAIGPTModel.from_pretrained(\"openai-gpt\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer, TFOpenAIGPTModel\n\ntokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"openai-gpt\")\nmodel = TFOpenAIGPTModel.from_pretrained(\"openai-gpt\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"tf\")\noutputs = model(inputs)\n\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\n```\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThis model can be used for language modeling tasks.\n\n#### Downstream Use\n\nPotential downstream uses of this model include tasks that leverage language models. In the [associated paper]( the model developers discuss evaluations of the model for tasks including natural language inference (NLI), question answering, semantic similarity, and text classification.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n#### Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware that language generated by this model can be disturbing or offensive to some and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)]( and [Bender et al. (2021)]( \nPredictions generated by this model can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='openai-gpt')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"The man worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'The man worked as a teacher for the college he'},\n {'generated_text': 'The man worked as a janitor at the club.'},\n {'generated_text': 'The man worked as a bodyguard in america. the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The man worked as a clerk for one of the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The man worked as a nurse, but there was'}]\n\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"The woman worked as a\", max_length=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'The woman worked as a medical intern but is a'},\n {'generated_text': 'The woman worked as a midwife, i know that'},\n {'generated_text': 'The woman worked as a prostitute in a sex club'},\n {'generated_text': 'The woman worked as a secretary for one of the'},\n {'generated_text': 'The woman worked as a nurse, but she had'}]\n```\n\nThis bias may also affect fine-tuned versions of this model. Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n#### Risks and Limitations\n\nThe model developers also wrote in a [blog post]( about risks and limitations of the model, including: \n\n> - **Compute Requirements:** Many previous approaches to NLP tasks train relatively small models on a single GPU from scratch. Our approach requires an expensive pre-training step - 1 month on 8 GPUs. Luckily, this only has to be done once and weâre releasing our model so others can avoid it. It is also a large model (in comparison to prior work) and consequently uses more compute and memory â we used a 37-layer (12 block) Transformer architecture, and we train on sequences of up to 512 tokens. Most experiments were conducted on 4 and 8 GPU systems. The model does fine-tune to new tasks very quickly which helps mitigate the additional resource requirements.\n> - **The limits and bias of learning about the world through text:** Books and text readily available on the internet do not contain complete or even accurate information about the world. Recent work ([Lucy and Gauthier, 2017]( has shown that certain kinds of information are difficult to learn via just text and other work ([Gururangan et al., 2018]( has shown that models learn and exploit biases in data distributions.\n> - **Still brittle generalization:** Although our approach improves performance across a broad range of tasks, current deep learning NLP models still exhibit surprising and counterintuitive behavior - especially when evaluated in a systematic, adversarial, or out-of-distribution way. Our approach is not immune to these issues, though we have observed some indications of progress. Our approach shows improved lexical robustness over previous purely neural approaches to textual entailment. On the dataset introduced in Glockner et al. (2018) our model achieves 83.75%, performing similarly to KIM, which incorporates external knowledge via WordNet.\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe model developers [write]( \n\n> We use the BooksCorpus dataset ([Zhu et al., 2015]( for training the language model. It contains over 7,000 unique unpublished books from a variety of genres including Adventure, Fantasy, and Romance. Crucially, it contains long stretches of contiguous text, which allows the generative model to learn to condition on long-range information.\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\nThe model developers [write]( \n\n> Our model largely follows the original transformer work [62]. We trained a 12-layer decoder-only transformer with masked self-attention heads (768 dimensional states and 12 attention heads). For the position-wise feed-forward networks, we used 3072 dimensional inner states. We used the Adam optimization scheme [27] with a max learning rate of 2.5e-4. The learning rate was increased linearly from zero over the first 2000 updates and annealed to 0 using a cosine schedule. We train for 100 epochs on minibatches of 64 randomly sampled, contiguous sequences of 512 tokens. Since layernorm [2] is used extensively throughout the model, a simple weight initialization of N (0, 0.02) was sufficient. We used a bytepair encoding (BPE) vocabulary with 40,000 merges [53] and residual, embedding, and attention dropouts with a rate of 0.1 for regularization. We also employed a modified version of L2 regularization proposed in [37], with w = 0.01 on all non bias or gain weights. For the activation function, we used the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) [18]. We used learned position embeddings instead of the sinusoidal version proposed in the original work. We use the ftfy library2 to clean the raw text in BooksCorpus, standardize some punctuation and whitespace, and use the spaCy tokenizer.\n\nSee the paper for further details and links to citations.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe following evaluation information is extracted from the [associated blog post]( See the [associated paper]( for further details.\n\n#### Testing Data, Factors and Metrics\n\nThe model developers report that the model was evaluated on the following tasks and datasets using the listed metrics: \n\n- **Task:** Textual Entailment\n  - **Datasets:** [SNLI]( [MNLI Matched]( [MNLI Mismatched]( [SciTail]( [QNLI]( [RTE](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy  \n \n- **Task:** Semantic Similarity\n  - **Datasets:** [STS-B]( [QQP]( [MRPC](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy\n \n- **Task:** Reading Comprehension\n  - **Datasets:** [RACE](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy\n \n- **Task:** Commonsense Reasoning\n  - **Datasets:** [ROCStories]( [COPA](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy\n \n- **Task:** Sentiment Analysis\n  - **Datasets:** [SST-2](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy\n \n- **Task:** Linguistic Acceptability\n  - **Datasets:** [CoLA](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy\n \n- **Task:** Multi Task Benchmark\n  - **Datasets:** [GLUE](\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy\n\n#### Results\n\nThe model achieves the following results without any fine-tuning (zero-shot):\n\n TE  TE             TE     SS  SS  CR        SA    MTB  |\n:--::-------------::----::---::--::--------::----::----:|\nSNLIMNLI Mismatched QNLI STS-BMPRCROCStories SST-2 GLUE |\n89.9 81.4           88.1 82.0 82.3  86.5     91.3  72.8 | \n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nThe model developers [report that]( \n\n> The total compute used to train this model was 0.96 petaflop days (pfs-days).\n\n> 8 P600 GPU's * 30 days * 12 TFLOPS/GPU * 0.33 utilization = .96 pfs-days\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator]( presented in [Lacoste et al.

The model can be used to predict if text was generated by a GPT-2 model. This model was released by OpenAI at the same time as OpenAI released the weights of the [largest GPT-2 model]( the 1.5B parameter version. \n\n- **Developed by:** OpenAI, see [GitHub Repo]( and [associated paper]( for full author list\n- **Model Type:** Fine-tuned transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **License:** MIT\n- **Related Models:** [RoBERTa base]( [GPT-XL (1.5B parameter version)]( [GPT-Large (the 774M parameter version)]( [GPT-Medium (the 355M parameter version)]( and [GPT-2 (the 124M parameter version)](\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research Paper]( (see, in particular, the section beginning on page 12 about Automated ML-based detection).\n  - [GitHub Repo](\n  - [OpenAI Blog Post](\n  - [Explore the detector model here]( )\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThe model is a classifier that can be used to detect text generated by GPT-2 models. However, it is strongly suggested not to use it as a ChatGPT detector for the purposes of making grave allegations of academic misconduct against undergraduates and others, as this model might give inaccurate results in the case of ChatGPT-generated input.\n\n#### Downstream Use\n\nThe model's developers have stated that they developed and released the model to help with research related to synthetic text generation, so the model could potentially be used for downstream tasks related to synthetic text generation. See the [associated paper]( for further discussion.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model developers discuss the risk of adversaries using the model to better evade detection in their [associated paper]( suggesting that using the model for evading detection or for supporting efforts to evade detection would be a misuse of the model. \n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section may contain content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n#### Risks and Limitations\n\nIn their [associated paper]( the model developers discuss the risk that the model may be used by bad actors to develop capabilities for evading detection, though one purpose of releasing the model is to help improve detection research. \n\nIn a related [blog post]( the model developers also discuss the limitations of automated methods for detecting synthetic text and the need to pair automated detection tools with other, non-automated approaches. They write: \n\n> We conducted in-house detection research and developed a detection model that has detection rates of ~95% for detecting 1.5B GPT-2-generated text. We believe this is not high enough accuracy for standalone detection and needs to be paired with metadata-based approaches, human judgment, and public education to be more effective. \n\nThe model developers also [report]( finding that classifying content from larger models is more difficult, suggesting that detection with automated tools like this model will be increasingly difficult as model sizes increase. The authors find that training detector models on the outputs of larger models can improve accuracy and robustness. \n\n#### Bias\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)]( and [Bender et al. (2021)]( Predictions generated by RoBERTa base and GPT-2 1.5B (which this model is built/fine-tuned on) can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups (see the [RoBERTa base]( and [GPT-2 XL]( model cards for more information). The developers of this model discuss these issues further in their [paper](\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe model is a sequence classifier based on RoBERTa base (see the [RoBERTa base model card]( for more details on the RoBERTa base training data) and then fine-tuned using the outputs of the 1.5B GPT-2 model (available [here](\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\nThe model developers write that: \n\n> We based a sequence classifier on RoBERTaBASE (125 million parameters) and fine-tuned it to classify the outputs from the 1.5B GPT-2 model versus WebText, the dataset we used to train the GPT-2 model.\n\nThey later state: \n\n> To develop a robust detector model that can accurately classify generated texts regardless of the sampling method, we performed an analysis of the modelâs transfer performance.\n\nSee the [associated paper]( for further details on the training procedure.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe following evaluation information is extracted from the [associated paper](\n\n#### Testing Data, Factors and Metrics\n\nThe model is intended to be used for detecting text generated by GPT-2 models, so the model developers test the model on text datasets, measuring accuracy by: \n\n> testing 510-token test examples comprised of 5,000 samples from the WebText dataset and 5,000 samples generated by a GPT-2 model, which were not used during the training.\n\n#### Results\n\nThe model developers [find]( \n\n> Our classifier is able to detect 1.5 billion parameter GPT-2-generated text with approximately 95% accuracy...The modelâs accuracy depends on sampling methods used when generating outputs, like temperature, Top-K, and nucleus sampling ([Holtzman et al., 2019]( Nucleus sampling outputs proved most difficult to correctly classify, but a detector trained using nucleus sampling transfers well across other sampling methods. As seen in Figure 1 [in the paper], we found consistently high accuracy when trained on nucleus sampling. \t\n\nSee the [associated paper]( Figure 1 (on page 14) and Figure 2 (on page 16) for full results.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator]( presented in [Lacoste et al.

It was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released in\n[this repository]( This model is case-sensitive: it\nmakes a difference between english and English.\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing RoBERTa did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nRoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means\nit was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. \n\nMore precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model\nrandomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict\nthe masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one\nafter the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to\nlearn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for masked language modeling, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.\nSee the [model hub]( to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that\ninterests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at a model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='roberta-base')\n>>> unmasker(\"Hello I'm a <mask> model.\")\n\n[{'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a male model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.3306540250778198,\n  'token': 2943,\n  'token_str': 'Ä male'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a female model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.04655390977859497,\n  'token': 2182,\n  'token_str': 'Ä female'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a professional model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.04232972860336304,\n  'token': 2038,\n  'token_str': 'Ä professional'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a fashion model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.037216778844594955,\n  'token': 2734,\n  'token_str': 'Ä fashion'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a Russian model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.03253649175167084,\n  'token': 1083,\n  'token_str': 'Ä Russian'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base')\nmodel = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-base')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, TFRobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base')\nmodel = TFRobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-base')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from\nneutral. Therefore, the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='roberta-base')\n>>> unmasker(\"The man worked as a <mask>.\")\n\n[{'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a mechanic.</s>',\n  'score': 0.08702439814805984,\n  'token': 25682,\n  'token_str': 'Ä mechanic'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a waiter.</s>',\n  'score': 0.0819653645157814,\n  'token': 38233,\n  'token_str': 'Ä waiter'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a butcher.</s>',\n  'score': 0.073323555290699,\n  'token': 32364,\n  'token_str': 'Ä butcher'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a miner.</s>',\n  'score': 0.046322137117385864,\n  'token': 18678,\n  'token_str': 'Ä miner'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a guard.</s>',\n  'score': 0.040150221437215805,\n  'token': 2510,\n  'token_str': 'Ä guard'}]\n\n>>> unmasker(\"The Black woman worked as a <mask>.\")\n\n[{'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a waitress.</s>',\n  'score': 0.22177888453006744,\n  'token': 35698,\n  'token_str': 'Ä waitress'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a prostitute.</s>',\n  'score': 0.19288744032382965,\n  'token': 36289,\n  'token_str': 'Ä prostitute'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a maid.</s>',\n  'score': 0.06498628109693527,\n  'token': 29754,\n  'token_str': 'Ä maid'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a secretary.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05375480651855469,\n  'token': 2971,\n  'token_str': 'Ä secretary'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a nurse.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05245552211999893,\n  'token': 9008,\n  'token_str': 'Ä nurse'}]\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe RoBERTa model was pretrained on the reunion of five datasets:\n- [BookCorpus]( a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books;\n- [English Wikipedia]( (excluding lists, tables and headers) ;\n- [CC-News]( a dataset containing 63 millions English news\n  articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019.\n- [OpenWebText]( an opensource recreation of the WebText dataset used to\n  train GPT-2,\n- [Stories]( a dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\n  story-like style of Winograd schemas.\n\nTogether these datasets weigh 160GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50,000. The inputs of\nthe model take pieces of 512 contiguous tokens that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked\nwith `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\nContrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 1024 V100 GPUs for 500K steps with a batch size of 8K and a sequence length of 512. The\noptimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 6e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\), \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.98\\\\) and\n\\\\(\\epsilon = 1e-6\\\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 24,000 steps and linear decay of the learning\nrate after.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:\n\nGlue test results:\n\n MNLI  QNLI  CoLA  MRPC \n:----::----::----::----:\n 87.6  92.8  63.6  90.2 \n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692,\n  author    = {Yinhan Liu and\n               Myle Ott and\n               Naman Goyal and\n               Jingfei Du and\n               Mandar Joshi and\n               Danqi Chen and\n               Omer Levy and\n               Mike Lewis and\n               Luke Zettlemoyer and\n               Veselin Stoyanov},\n  title     = {RoBERTa: {A} Robustly Optimized {BERT} Pretraining Approach},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1907.11692},\n  year      = {2019},\n  url       = {\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1907.11692},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 01 Aug 2019 08:59:33 +0200},\n  biburl    = {\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, \n}\n```\n\n<a href=\"\n\t<img width=\"300px\" src=\"\n</a>\n",

The model is a pretrained model on English language text using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.\n\n- **Developed by:** See [GitHub Repo]( for model developers\n- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model\n- **Language(s):** English\n- **License:** MIT \n- **Parent Model:** This model is a fine-tuned version of the RoBERTa large model. Users should see the [RoBERTa large model card]( for relevant information.\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research Paper](\n  - [GitHub Repo](\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model \n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. The model can be loaded with the zero-shot-classification pipeline like so:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nclassifier = pipeline('zero-shot-classification', model='roberta-large-mnli')\n```\n\nYou can then use this pipeline to classify sequences into any of the class names you specify. For example:\n\n```python\nsequence_to_classify = \"one day I will see the world\"\ncandidate_labels = ['travel', 'cooking', 'dancing']\nclassifier(sequence_to_classify, candidate_labels)\n```\n\n## Uses\n\n#### Direct Use\n\nThis fine-tuned model can be used for zero-shot classification tasks, including zero-shot sentence-pair classification (see the [GitHub repo]( for examples) and zero-shot sequence classification.\n\n#### Misuse and Out-of-scope Use\n\nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section contains content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propogate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)]( and [Bender et al. (2021)]( The [RoBERTa large model card]( notes that: \"The training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral.\" \n\nPredictions generated by the model can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups. For example:\n\n```python\nsequence_to_classify = \"The CEO had a strong handshake.\"\ncandidate_labels = ['male', 'female']\nhypothesis_template = \"This text speaks about a {} profession.\"\nclassifier(sequence_to_classify, candidate_labels, hypothesis_template=hypothesis_template)\n```\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThis model was fine-tuned on the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)]( corpus.

Specifically, the model was evaluated on the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)]( corpus. See the [GLUE data card]( or [Wang et al. (2019)]( for further information.\n  - **Tasks:** NLI. [Wang et al. (2019)]( describe the inference task for MNLI as: \n  > The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus [(Williams et al., 2018)]( is a crowd-sourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations. Given a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence, the task is to predict whether the premise entails the hypothesis (entailment), contradicts the hypothesis (contradiction), or neither (neutral). The premise sentences are gathered from ten different sources, including transcribed speech, fiction, and government reports. We use the standard test set, for which we obtained private labels from the authors, and evaluate on both the matched (in-domain) and mismatched (cross-domain) sections. We also use and recommend the SNLI corpus [(Bowman et al., 2015)]( as 550k examples of auxiliary training data.\n  - **Metrics:** Accuracy  \n  \n- **Dataset:** [XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018)]( the extension of the [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)]( corpus to 15 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi, Swahili and Urdu.

In addition, the model developers discuss the risk of adversaries using the model to better evade detection in their [associated paper]( suggesting that using the model for evading detection or for supporting efforts to evade detection would be a misuse of the model. \n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section may contain content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.\n\n#### Risks and Limitations\n\nIn their [associated paper]( the model developers discuss the risk that the model may be used by bad actors to develop capabilities for evading detection, though one purpose of releasing the model is to help improve detection research. \n\nIn a related [blog post]( the model developers also discuss the limitations of automated methods for detecting synthetic text and the need to pair automated detection tools with other, non-automated approaches. They write: \n\n> We conducted in-house detection research and developed a detection model that has detection rates of ~95% for detecting 1.5B GPT-2-generated text. We believe this is not high enough accuracy for standalone detection and needs to be paired with metadata-based approaches, human judgment, and public education to be more effective. \n\nThe model developers also [report]( finding that classifying content from larger models is more difficult, suggesting that detection with automated tools like this model will be increasingly difficult as model sizes increase. The authors find that training detector models on the outputs of larger models can improve accuracy and robustness. \n\n#### Bias\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)]( and [Bender et al. (2021)]( Predictions generated by RoBERTa large and GPT-2 1.5B (which this model is built/fine-tuned on) can include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups (see the [RoBERTa large]( and [GPT-2 XL]( model cards for more information). The developers of this model discuss these issues further in their [paper](\n\n## Training\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe model is a sequence classifier based on RoBERTa large (see the [RoBERTa large model card]( for more details on the RoBERTa large training data) and then fine-tuned using the outputs of the 1.5B GPT-2 model (available [here](\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\nThe model developers write that: \n\n> We based a sequence classifier on RoBERTaLARGE (355 million parameters) and fine-tuned it to classify the outputs from the 1.5B GPT-2 model versus WebText, the dataset we used to train the GPT-2 model.\n\nThey later state: \n\n> To develop a robust detector model that can accurately classify generated texts regardless of the sampling method, we performed an analysis of the modelâs transfer performance.\n\nSee the [associated paper]( for further details on the training procedure.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe following evaluation information is extracted from the [associated paper](\n\n#### Testing Data, Factors and Metrics\n\nThe model is intended to be used for detecting text generated by GPT-2 models, so the model developers test the model on text datasets, measuring accuracy by: \n\n> testing 510-token test examples comprised of 5,000 samples from the WebText dataset and 5,000 samples generated by a GPT-2 model, which were not used during the training.\n\n#### Results\n\nThe model developers [find]( \n\n> Our classifier is able to detect 1.5 billion parameter GPT-2-generated text with approximately 95% accuracy...The modelâs accuracy depends on sampling methods used when generating outputs, like temperature, Top-K, and nucleus sampling ([Holtzman et al., 2019]( Nucleus sampling outputs proved most difficult to correctly classify, but a detector trained using nucleus sampling transfers well across other sampling methods. As seen in Figure 1 [in the paper], we found consistently high accuracy when trained on nucleus sampling. \t\n\nSee the [associated paper]( Figure 1 (on page 14) and Figure 2 (on page 16) for full results.\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator]( presented in [Lacoste et al.

It was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released in\n[this repository]( This model is case-sensitive: it\nmakes a difference between english and English.\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing RoBERTa did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nRoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means\nit was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. \n\nMore precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model\nrandomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict\nthe masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one\nafter the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to\nlearn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for masked language modeling, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.\nSee the [model hub]( to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that\ninterests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='roberta-large')\n>>> unmasker(\"Hello I'm a <mask> model.\")\n\n[{'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a male model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.3317350447177887,\n  'token': 2943,\n  'token_str': 'Ä male'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a fashion model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.14171843230724335,\n  'token': 2734,\n  'token_str': 'Ä fashion'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a professional model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.04291723668575287,\n  'token': 2038,\n  'token_str': 'Ä professional'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a freelance model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.02134818211197853,\n  'token': 18150,\n  'token_str': 'Ä freelance'},\n {'sequence': \"<s>Hello I'm a young model.</s>\",\n  'score': 0.021098261699080467,\n  'token': 664,\n  'token_str': 'Ä young'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-large')\nmodel = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-large')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, TFRobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-large')\nmodel = TFRobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-large')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from\nneutral. Therefore, the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='roberta-large')\n>>> unmasker(\"The man worked as a <mask>.\")\n\n[{'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a mechanic.</s>',\n  'score': 0.08260300755500793,\n  'token': 25682,\n  'token_str': 'Ä mechanic'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a driver.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05736079439520836,\n  'token': 1393,\n  'token_str': 'Ä driver'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a teacher.</s>',\n  'score': 0.04709019884467125,\n  'token': 3254,\n  'token_str': 'Ä teacher'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a bartender.</s>',\n  'score': 0.04641604796051979,\n  'token': 33080,\n  'token_str': 'Ä bartender'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a waiter.</s>',\n  'score': 0.04239227622747421,\n  'token': 38233,\n  'token_str': 'Ä waiter'}]\n\n>>> unmasker(\"The woman worked as a <mask>.\")\n\n[{'sequence': '<s>The woman worked as a nurse.</s>',\n  'score': 0.2667474150657654,\n  'token': 9008,\n  'token_str': 'Ä nurse'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The woman worked as a waitress.</s>',\n  'score': 0.12280137836933136,\n  'token': 35698,\n  'token_str': 'Ä waitress'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The woman worked as a teacher.</s>',\n  'score': 0.09747499972581863,\n  'token': 3254,\n  'token_str': 'Ä teacher'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The woman worked as a secretary.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05783602222800255,\n  'token': 2971,\n  'token_str': 'Ä secretary'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The woman worked as a cleaner.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05576248839497566,\n  'token': 16126,\n  'token_str': 'Ä cleaner'}]\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe RoBERTa model was pretrained on the reunion of five datasets:\n- [BookCorpus]( a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books;\n- [English Wikipedia]( (excluding lists, tables and headers) ;\n- [CC-News]( a dataset containing 63 millions English news\n  articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019.\n- [OpenWebText]( an opensource recreation of the WebText dataset used to\n  train GPT-2,\n- [Stories]( a dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\n  story-like style of Winograd schemas.\n\nTogether theses datasets weight 160GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50,000. The inputs of\nthe model take pieces of 512 contiguous token that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked\nwith `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.\n\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\nContrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 1024 V100 GPUs for 500K steps with a batch size of 8K and a sequence length of 512. The\noptimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 4e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\), \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.98\\\\) and\n\\\\(\\epsilon = 1e-6\\\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 30,000 steps and linear decay of the learning\nrate after.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:\n\nGlue test results:\n\n MNLI  QNLI  CoLA  MRPC \n:----::----::----::----:\n 90.2  94.7  68.0  90.9 \n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692,\n  author    = {Yinhan Liu and\n               Myle Ott and\n               Naman Goyal and\n               Jingfei Du and\n               Mandar Joshi and\n               Danqi Chen and\n               Omer Levy and\n               Mike Lewis and\n               Luke Zettlemoyer and\n               Veselin Stoyanov},\n  title     = {RoBERTa: {A} Robustly Optimized {BERT} Pretraining Approach},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1907.11692},\n  year      = {2019},\n  url       = {\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1907.11692},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 01 Aug 2019 08:59:33 +0200},\n  biburl    = {\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, \n}\n```\n\n<a href=\"\n\t<img width=\"300px\" src=\"\n</a>\n",

The dataset used for this fine-tuning is STSb extended to 15 languages with Google Translator. For mantaining data quality the sentence pairs with a confidence value below 0.7 were dropped. The extended dataset is available at [GitHub]( The languages included in the extended version are: ar, cs, de, en, es, fr, hi, it, ja, nl, pl, pt, ru, tr, zh-CN, zh-TW. The pooling operation used to condense the word embeddings into a sentence embedding is mean pooling (more info below). \n\n<!-- ## Usage (Sentence-Transformers)\n\nUsing this model becomes easy when you have [sentence-transformers]( installed:\n\n```\npip install -U sentence-transformers\n```\n\nThen you can use the model like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n# It support several languages\nsentences = [\"This is an example sentence\", \"Esta es otra frase de ejemplo\", \"æå¾ã®ä¾æ\"]\n\n# The pooling technique is automatically detected (mean pooling)\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('mstsb-paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n``` -->\n\n\n\n## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)\nWithout [sentence-transformers]( you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n\n# We should define the proper pooling function: Mean pooling\n# Mean Pooling - Take attention mask into account for correct averaging\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output[0] #First element of model_output contains all token embeddings\n    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\n    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\n\n\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nsentences = [\"This is an example sentence\", \"Esta es otra frase de ejemplo\", \"æå¾ã®ä¾æ\"]\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('AIDA-UPM/mstsb-paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('AIDA-UPM/mstsb-paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2')\n\n# Tokenize sentences\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Compute token embeddings\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n\n# Perform pooling.

The 15 languages available at the [Multilingual STSB]( have been combined into monolingual and cross-lingual tasks, giving a total of 31 tasks. Monolingual tasks have both sentences from the same language source (e.g., Ar-Ar, Es-Es), while cross-lingual tasks have two sentences, each in a different language being one of them English (e.g., en-ar, en-es). \n\n\nHere we compare the average multilingual semantic textual similairty capabilities between the  `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` based model and the `mstsb-paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` fine-tuned model across the 31 tasks. It is worth noting that both models are multilingual, but the second model is adjusted with multilingual data for semantic similarity. The average of correlation coefficients is computed by transforming each correlation coefficient to a Fisher's z value, averaging them, and then back-transforming to a correlation coefficient.\n\n\n Average Spearman Cosine Test |\n:------------------------------:|\n 0.835890                     |\n 0.818896                     |\n\n<br>\n\nThe following tables breakdown the performance of `mstsb-paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` according to the different tasks.

Due to the lack of data for abstractive summarization on low-resource languages such as Italian, we propose two new original datasets collected from two Italian news websites with multi-sentence summaries and corresponding articles, and from a dataset obtained by machine translation of a Spanish summarization dataset. These two datasets are currently the only two available in Italian for this task. To evaluate the quality of these two datasets, we used them to train a T5-base model and an mBART model, obtaining good results with both. To better evaluate the results obtained, we also compared the same models trained on automatically translated datasets, and the resulting summaries in the same training language, with the automatically translated summaries, which demonstrated the superiority of the models obtained from the proposed datasets.},\n    DOI = {10.3390/info13050228}\n}\n```",

It was introduced in this [paper]( and first released in this [repository]( This model is case-sensitive: it makes a difference between english and English.\n\n\n\n## Pretained Model Description\nBERT is an auto-encoder transformer model pretrained on a large corpus of English data (English Wikipedia + Books Corpus) in a self-supervised fashion. This means the targets are computed from the inputs themselves, and humans are not needed to label the data. It was pretrained with two objectives:\n\n- Masked language modeling (MLM)\n- Next sentence prediction (NSP)\n\n## Fine-tuned Model Description: BERT fine-tuned Cola\nThe pretrained model could be fine-tuned on other NLP tasks. The BERT model has been fine-tuned on a cola dataset from the GLUE BENCHAMRK, which is an academic benchmark that aims to measure the performance of ML models. Cola is one of the 11 datasets in this GLUE BENCHMARK.Â \n\nBy fine-tuning BERT on cola dataset, the model is now able to classify a given setence gramatically and semantically as acceptable or not acceptable\n\n## How to use ?\n###### Directly with a pipeline for a text-classification NLP task\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\ncola = pipeline('text-classification', model='Abirate/bert_fine_tuned_cola')\ncola(\"Tunisia is a beautiful country\")\n\n[{'label': 'acceptable', 'score': 0.989352285861969}]\n```\n###### Breaking down all the steps (Tokenization, Modeling, Postprocessing)\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np  \n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('Abirate/bert_fine_tuned_cola')\nmodel = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"Abirate/bert_fine_tuned_cola\")\ntext = \"Tunisia is a beautiful country.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\n\n#The logits\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n#Postprocessing\nprobas_output = tf.math.softmax(tf.squeeze(output['logits']), axis = -1)\nclass_preds = np.argmax(probas_output, axis = -1)\n\n#Predicting the class acceptable or not acceptable\nmodel.config.id2label[class_preds]\n\n#Result \n'acceptable'\n```",

It was first introduced in the paper Training data-efficient image transformers & distillation through attention by Touvron et al. \nVision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained and fine-tuned on Self Currated Custom Face-Mask18K Dataset (18k images, 2 classes) at resolution 224x224. It was introduced in the paper An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale by Dosovitskiy et al.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nNote that this model does not provide any fine-tuned heads, as these were zero'd by Google researchers. However, the model does include the pre-trained pooler, which can be used for downstream tasks (such as image classification).\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Training Metrics\n    epoch                    =        0.89\n    total_flos               = 923776502GF\n    train_loss               =       0.057\n    train_runtime            =  0:40:10.40\n    train_samples_per_second =      23.943\n    train_steps_per_second   =       1.497\n---\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n    epoch                   =       0.89\n    eval_accuracy           =     0.9894\n    eval_loss               =     0.0395\n    eval_runtime            = 0:00:36.81\n    eval_samples_per_second =     97.685\n    eval_steps_per_second   =     12.224",

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\"\n  example_title: \"BERT abstract\"\n---\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"ArvinZhuang/BiTAG-t5-large\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ArvinZhuang/BiTAG-t5-large\")\n\ntext = \"abstract: [your abstract]\"  # use 'title:' as the prefix for title_to_abs task.\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')\n\noutputs = model.generate(\n    input_ids,\n    do_sample=True,\n    max_length=500,\n    top_p=0.9,\n    top_k=20,\n    temperature=1,\n    num_return_sequences=10,\n)\n\nprint(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\nfor i, output in enumerate(outputs):\n    print(\"{}: {}\".format(i+1, tokenizer.decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)))\n\n```\nGitHub: ",

As in the dataset, each token will be classified as one of the following classes:\nAbbreviation|Description\n-|-\nO|Outside of a named entity\nB-DATE |Beginning of a DATE entity right after another DATE entity\nI-DATE |DATE entity\nB-PER |Beginning of a personâs name right after another personâs name\nI-PER |Personâs name\nB-ORG |Beginning of an organisation right after another organisation\nI-ORG |Organisation\nB-LOC |Beginning of a location right after another location\nI-LOC |Location\n## Training procedure\nThis model was trained on a single NVIDIA V100 GPU with recommended hyperparameters from the [original MasakhaNER paper]( which trained & evaluated the model on MasakhaNER corpus. \n## Eval results on Test set (F-score)\nlanguage|F1-score\n-|-\nhau |88.88\nibo |84.87\nkin |74.19\nlug |78.43\nluo |73.32\npcm |87.98\nswa |86.20\nwol |64.67\nyor |78.10\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n```\n@article{adelani21tacl,\n    title = {Masakha{NER}: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages},\n    author = {David Ifeoluwa Adelani and Jade Abbott and Graham Neubig and Daniel D'souza and Julia Kreutzer and Constantine Lignos and Chester Palen-Michel and Happy Buzaaba and Shruti Rijhwani and Sebastian Ruder and Stephen Mayhew and Israel Abebe Azime and Shamsuddeen Muhammad and Chris Chinenye Emezue and Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende and Perez Ogayo and Anuoluwapo Aremu and Catherine Gitau and Derguene Mbaye and Jesujoba Alabi and Seid Muhie Yimam and Tajuddeen Gwadabe and Ignatius Ezeani and Rubungo Andre Niyongabo and Jonathan Mukiibi and Verrah Otiende and Iroro Orife and Davis David and Samba Ngom and Tosin Adewumi and Paul Rayson and Mofetoluwa Adeyemi and Gerald Muriuki and Emmanuel Anebi and Chiamaka Chukwuneke and Nkiruka Odu and Eric Peter Wairagala and Samuel Oyerinde and Clemencia Siro and Tobius Saul Bateesa and Temilola Oloyede and Yvonne Wambui and Victor Akinode and Deborah Nabagereka and Maurice Katusiime and Ayodele Awokoya and Mouhamadane MBOUP and Dibora Gebreyohannes and Henok Tilaye and Kelechi Nwaike and Degaga Wolde and Abdoulaye Faye and Blessing Sibanda and Orevaoghene Ahia and Bonaventure F.

GPT-2 was introduced in\n[this paper](\nand first released at [this page](\n\n**Note**: this model is 345M parameter variant as in Huggingface's [GPT-2-medium config]( so not the famous big 1.5B parameter variant by OpenAI. We also have bigger 774M parameter variant [gpt2-large-finnish]( available which performs better compared to this model.\n\n## Model description\n\nFinnish GPT-2 is a transformers model pretrained on a very large corpus of Finnish data in a self-supervised fashion. This\nmeans it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots\nof publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely,\nit was trained to guess the next word in sentences.\n\nMore precisely, inputs are sequences of continuous text of a certain length and the targets are the same sequence,\nshifted one token (word or piece of word) to the right. The model uses internally a mask-mechanism to make sure the\npredictions for the token `i` only uses the inputs from `1` to `i` but not the future tokens.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the Finnish language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating texts from a\nprompt.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for text generation or fine-tune it to a downstream task. See the\n[model hub]( to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='Finnish-NLP/gpt2-medium-finnish')\n>>> generator(\"TekstiÃ¤ tuottava tekoÃ¤ly on\", max_length=30, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': 'TekstiÃ¤ tuottava tekoÃ¤ly on tullut ihmisten arkeen viime vuosina. Se auttaa hahmottamaan ja tulkitsemaan monimutkaisia kokonaisuuksia ja ilmiÃ¶itÃ¤, joita ihmiset tekevÃ¤t esimerkiksi ruokakaupassa'},\n {'generated_text': 'TekstiÃ¤ tuottava tekoÃ¤ly on jo ottanut haltuunsa myÃ¶s ihmisten kÃ¤yttÃ¤miÃ¤ sovelluksia ja esimerkiksi pankkipalveluita. Sen vuoksi tekoÃ¤ly on tÃ¤rkeÃ¤ kumppani etenkin yritysten liiketoiminnan kehittÃ¤misessÃ¤.-'},\n {'generated_text': 'TekstiÃ¤ tuottava tekoÃ¤ly on tekoÃ¤lylle luonnollinen valinta, sillÃ¤ sen avulla voi kommunikoida ihmisten kanssa hyvin pitkÃ¤lle samalla tavalla kuin tietokoneiden kanssa. Se on kehittynyt muun'},\n {'generated_text': 'TekstiÃ¤ tuottava tekoÃ¤ly on ihmisen kehittÃ¤mÃ¤ tekoÃ¤ly, jota ei vielÃ¤ ole pystytty rakentamaan. TekoÃ¤ly kykenee toimimaan esimerkiksi matemaattisissa, tilastollisissa ja sosiaalisissa'},\n {'generated_text': 'TekstiÃ¤ tuottava tekoÃ¤ly on jo niin iso juttu ettei sitÃ¤ kannata rajoittaakaan. Ja jos se saadaan kÃ¤yttÃ¶Ã¶n, niin se voi jo pian syrjÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ perinteisen'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/gpt2-medium-finnish')\nmodel = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/gpt2-medium-finnish')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, TFGPT2Model\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/gpt2-medium-finnish')\nmodel = TFGPT2Model.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/gpt2-medium-finnish', from_pt=True)\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral. Therefore, the model can have biased predictions. This bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\nAs with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how the Finnish GPT-2 will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results.\n\n## Training data\n\nThis Finnish GPT-2 model was pretrained on the combination of six datasets:\n- [mc4_fi_cleaned]( the dataset mC4 is a multilingual colossal, cleaned version of Common Crawl's web crawl corpus. We used the Finnish subset of the mC4 dataset and further cleaned it with our own text data cleaning codes (check the dataset repo).\n- [wikipedia]( We used the Finnish subset of the wikipedia (August 2021) dataset\n- [Yle Finnish News Archive 2011-2018](\n- [Yle Finnish News Archive 2019-2020](\n- [Finnish News Agency Archive (STT)](\n- [The Suomi24 Sentences Corpus](\n\nRaw datasets were cleaned to filter out bad quality and non-Finnish examples. Together these cleaned datasets were around 84GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a\nvocabulary size of 50,257. The inputs are sequences of 512 consecutive tokens.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3-8 VM, sponsored by the [Google TPU Research Cloud]( for 360k steps (a bit over 1 epoch, 128 batch size). The optimizer used was a AdamW with learning rate 1e-4, learning rate warmup for 4000 steps and cosine decay of the learning rate after.\n\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nEvaluation was done using the *validation* split of the [mc4_fi_cleaned]( dataset with [Perplexity]( (smaller score the better) as the evaluation metric. As seen from the table below, this model (the first row of the table) performs better than our smaller [gpt2-finnish]( model variant but loses to our bigger [gpt2-large-finnish]( model.\n\n Perplexity |\n------------|\n34.08       |\n44.19       |\n**30.74**   |\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project would not have been possible without compute generously provided by Google through the\n[TPU Research Cloud](\n\n## Team Members\n\n- Aapo Tanskanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n- Rasmus Toivanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n\nFeel free to contact us for more details ð¤",

RoBERTa was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released in\n[this repository]( This model is case-sensitive: it\nmakes a difference between finnish and Finnish.\n\n## Model description\n\nFinnish RoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of Finnish data in a self-supervised fashion. This means\nit was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. \n\nMore precisely, it was pretrained with the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Taking a sentence, the model\nrandomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict\nthe masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one\nafter the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future tokens. It allows the model to\nlearn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the Finnish language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the RoBERTa model as inputs.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for masked language modeling, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='Finnish-NLP/roberta-large-finnish')\n>>> unmasker(\"Moikka olen <mask> kielimalli.\")\n\n[{'sequence': 'Moikka olen hyvÃ¤ kielimalli.',\n  'score': 0.1535797119140625,\n  'token': 767,\n  'token_str': ' hyvÃ¤'},\n {'sequence': 'Moikka olen paras kielimalli.',\n  'score': 0.04795042425394058,\n  'token': 2888,\n  'token_str': ' paras'},\n {'sequence': 'Moikka olen huono kielimalli.',\n  'score': 0.04251479730010033,\n  'token': 3217,\n  'token_str': ' huono'},\n {'sequence': 'Moikka olen myÃ¶s kielimalli.',\n  'score': 0.027469098567962646,\n  'token': 520,\n  'token_str': ' myÃ¶s'},\n {'sequence': 'Moikka olen se kielimalli.',\n  'score': 0.013878575526177883,\n  'token': 358,\n  'token_str': ' se'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/roberta-large-finnish')\nmodel = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/roberta-large-finnish')\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import RobertaTokenizer, TFRobertaModel\ntokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/roberta-large-finnish')\nmodel = TFRobertaModel.from_pretrained('Finnish-NLP/roberta-large-finnish', from_pt=True)\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from\nneutral. Therefore, the model can have biased predictions.\n\n## Training data\n\nThis Finnish RoBERTa model was pretrained on the combination of five datasets:\n- [mc4]( the dataset mC4 is a multilingual colossal, cleaned version of Common Crawl's web crawl corpus. We used the Finnish subset of the mC4 dataset\n- [wikipedia]( We used the Finnish subset of the wikipedia (August 2021) dataset\n- [Yle Finnish News Archive](\n- [Finnish News Agency Archive (STT)](\n- [The Suomi24 Sentences Corpus](\n\nRaw datasets were cleaned to filter out bad quality and non-Finnish examples. Together these cleaned datasets were around 78GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50265. The inputs of\nthe model take pieces of 512 contiguous token that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked\nwith `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.\n\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\nContrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3-8 VM, sponsored by the [Google TPU Research Cloud]( for 2 epochs with a sequence length of 128 and continuing for one more epoch with a sequence length of 512. The optimizer used is Adafactor with a learning rate of 2e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\), \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.98\\\\) and \\\\(\\epsilon = 1e-6\\\\), learning rate warmup for 1500 steps and linear decay of the learning rate after.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nEvaluation was done by fine-tuning the model on downstream text classification task with two different labeled datasets: [Yle News]( and [Eduskunta]( Yle News classification fine-tuning was done with two different sequence lengths: 128 and 512 but Eduskunta only with 128 sequence length.\nWhen fine-tuned on those datasets, this model (the first row of the table) achieves the following accuracy results compared to the [FinBERT (Finnish BERT)]( and to our previous [Finnish RoBERTa-large]( trained during the Hugging Face JAX/Flax community week:\n\n Average   Yle News 512 length \n-------------------------------\n88.02     95.23                \n**88.82** **95.49**            \n87.72     95.06                \n\nTo conclude, this model improves on our previous [Finnish RoBERTa-large]( model trained during the Hugging Face JAX/Flax community week but is still slightly (~ 1%) losing to the [FinBERT (Finnish BERT)]( model.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project would not have been possible without compute generously provided by Google through the\n[TPU Research Cloud](\n\n## Team Members\n\n- Aapo Tanskanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n- Rasmus Toivanen [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n- Tommi VehvilÃ¤inen [Hugging Face profile](\n\nFeel free to contact us for more details ð¤",

This model is a bilingual Swedish-English model trained according to instructions in the paper [Making Monolingual Sentence Embeddings Multilingual using Knowledge Distillation]( and the [documentation]( accompanying its companion python package. We have used the strongest available pretrained English Bi-Encoder ([all-mpnet-base-v2]( as a teacher model, and the pretrained Swedish [KB-BERT]( as the student model. \n\nA more detailed description of the model can be found in an article we published on the KBLab blog [here]( and for the updated model [here]( \n\n**Update**: We have released updated versions of the model since the initial release. The original model described in the blog post is **v1.0**. The current version is **v2.0**. The newer versions are trained on longer paragraphs, and have a longer max sequence length. **v2.0** is trained with a stronger teacher model and is the current default.\n\n Teacher Model \n---------\n [paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2](  \n [paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2](  \n [all-mpnet-base-v2](  \n\n<!--- Describe your model here -->\n\n## Usage (Sentence-Transformers)\n\nUsing this model becomes easy when you have [sentence-transformers]( installed:\n\n```\npip install -U sentence-transformers\n```\n\nThen you can use the model like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nsentences = [\"Det hÃ¤r Ã¤r en exempelmening\", \"Varje exempel blir konverterad\"]\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('KBLab/sentence-bert-swedish-cased')\nembeddings = model.encode(sentences)\nprint(embeddings)\n```\n\n### Loading an older model version (Sentence-Transformers)\n\nCurrently, the easiest way to load an older model version is to clone the model repository and load it from disk. For example, to clone the **v1.0** model:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch v1.0 \n```\n\nThen you can load the model by pointing to the local folder where you cloned the model:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"path_to_model_folder/sentence-bert-swedish-cased\")\n```\n\n\n## Usage (HuggingFace Transformers)\nWithout [sentence-transformers]( you can use the model like this: First, you pass your input through the transformer model, then you have to apply the right pooling-operation on-top of the contextualized word embeddings.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nimport torch\n\n\n#Mean Pooling - Take attention mask into account for correct averaging\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output[0] #First element of model_output contains all token embeddings\n    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\n    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\n\n\n# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for\nsentences = ['Det hÃ¤r Ã¤r en exempelmening', 'Varje exempel blir konverterad']\n\n# Load model from HuggingFace Hub\n# To load an older version, e.g. v1.0, add the argument revision=\"v1.0\" \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('KBLab/sentence-bert-swedish-cased')\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained('KBLab/sentence-bert-swedish-cased')\n\n# Tokenize sentences\nencoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Compute token embeddings\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded_input)\n\n# Perform pooling. In this case, max pooling.\nsentence_embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input['attention_mask'])\n\nprint(\"Sentence embeddings:\")\nprint(sentence_embeddings)\n```\n\n### Loading an older model (Hugginfface Transformers)\n\nTo load an older model specify the version tag with the `revision` arg. For example, to load the **v1.0** model, use the following code: \n\n```python\nAutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('KBLab/sentence-bert-swedish-cased', revision=\"v1.0\")\nAutoModel.from_pretrained('KBLab/sentence-bert-swedish-cased', revision=\"v1.0\")\n```\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\n<!--- Describe how your model was evaluated -->\n\nThe model was evaluated on [SweParaphrase v1.0]( and **SweParaphrase v2.0**. This test set is part of [SuperLim]( -- a Swedish evaluation suite for natural langage understanding tasks.  We calculated Pearson and Spearman correlation between predicted model similarity scores and the human similarity score labels. Results from **SweParaphrase v1.0** are displayed below. \n\n Pearson \n---------\n 0.9183  \n 0.9183  \n **0.9283**  \n\nThe following code snippet can be used to reproduce the above results:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    \"sweparaphrase-dev-165.csv\",\n    sep=\"\\t\",\n    header=None,\n    names=[\n        \"original_id\",\n        \"source\",\n        \"type\",\n        \"sentence_swe1\",\n        \"sentence_swe2\",\n        \"score\",\n        \"sentence1\",\n        \"sentence2\",\n    ],\n)\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(\"KBLab/sentence-bert-swedish-cased\")\n\nsentences1 = df[\"sentence_swe1\"].tolist()\nsentences2 = df[\"sentence_swe2\"].tolist()\n\n# Compute embedding for both lists\nembeddings1 = model.encode(sentences1, convert_to_tensor=True)\nembeddings2 = model.encode(sentences2, convert_to_tensor=True)\n\n# Compute cosine similarity after normalizing\nembeddings1 /= embeddings1.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\nembeddings2 /= embeddings2.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n\ncosine_scores = embeddings1 @ embeddings2.t()\nsentence_pair_scores = cosine_scores.diag()\n\ndf[\"model_score\"] = sentence_pair_scores.cpu().tolist()\nprint(df[[\"score\", \"model_score\"]].corr(method=\"spearman\"))\nprint(df[[\"score\", \"model_score\"]].corr(method=\"pearson\"))\n```\n\n### Sweparaphrase v2.0\n\nIn general, **v1.1** correlates the most with human assessment of text similarity on SweParaphrase v2.0. Below, we present zero-shot evaluation results on all data splits. They display the model's performance out of the box, without any fine-tuning.\n\n Data split  Spearman   |\n------------------------|\n train       0.8256     |\n train       **0.8302** |\n train       0.8059     |\n dev         0.8774     |\n dev         **0.8833** |\n dev         0.8668     |\n test        0.8476     |\n test        **0.8550** |\n test        0.8213     |\n\n### SweFAQ v2.0\n\nWhen it comes to retrieval tasks, **v2.0** performs the best by quite a substantial margin. It is better at matching the correct answer to a question compared to v1.1 and v1.0.\n\n Data split \n------------\n train      \n train      \n train      \n dev        \n dev        \n dev        \n test       \n test       \n test       \n\n\nExamples how to evaluate the models on some of the test sets of the SuperLim suites can be found on the following links: [evaluate_faq.py]( (Swedish FAQ), [evaluate_swesat.py]( (SweSAT synonyms), [evaluate_supersim.py]( (SuperSim).\n\n## Training\n\nAn article with more details on data and v1.0 of the model can be found on the [KBLab blog]( \n\nAround 14.6 million sentences from English-Swedish parallel corpuses were used to train the model.

Since NER only presents a limited picture of ÃlÃ¦ctra's capabilities I am very interested in further evaluations. Therefore, if you employ it for any task, feel free to hit me up your findings!\n\nÃlÃ¦ctra was, as mentioned, created to enhance the Danish NLP capabilties and please do note how this GitHub still does not support the Danish characters \"*Ã, Ã and Ã*\" as the title of this repository becomes \"*-l-ctra*\". How ironic.ð\n\nHere is an example on how to load the finetuned ÃlÃ¦ctra-cased model for Named Entity Recognition in [PyTorch]( using the [ð¤Transformers]( library:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Maltehb/-l-ctra-danish-electra-small-cased-ner-dane\")\nmodel = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(\"Maltehb/-l-ctra-danish-electra-small-cased-ner-dane\")\n```\n\n### Evaluation of current Danish Language Models \n\nÃlÃ¦ctra, Danish BERT (DaBERT) and multilingual BERT (mBERT) were evaluated:\n\n Layers  Params  Average Inference Time (Sec/Epoch)  \n ---  ---  --- \n 12  13.7M  10.91  \n 12  14.7M  10.92  \n 12  110M  43.03  \n 12  167M  72.10  \n 12  177M  70.56  \n\n\nOn [DaNE]( (Hvingelby et al., 2020) without the *MISC-tag*, ÃlÃ¦ctra scores slightly worse than both cased and uncased Multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and Danish BERT (Danish BERT, 2019/2020), however, ÃlÃ¦ctra is less than one third the size, and uses significantly fewer computational resources to pretrain and instantiate.\n\n### Pretraining\nTo pretrain ÃlÃ¦ctra it is recommended to build a Docker Container from the [Dockerfile]( Next, simply follow the [pretraining notebooks]( \n\nThe pretraining was done by utilizing a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 16 GiB, endowed by the Danish data company [KMD]( The pretraining took approximately 4 days and 9.5 hours for both the cased and uncased model\n\n### Fine-tuning\nTo fine-tune any ÃlÃ¦ctra model follow the [fine-tuning notebooks](\n\n### References\nClark, K., Luong, M.-T., Le, Q.

It was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released in\n[this repository]( This model is trained on uppercase amino acids: it only works with capital letter amino acids.\n\n\n## Model description\n\nProtT5-XL-BFD is based on the `t5-3b` model and was pretrained on a large corpus of protein sequences in a self-supervised fashion.\nThis means it was pretrained on the raw protein sequences only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those protein sequences.\n\nOne important difference between this T5 model and the original T5 version is the denosing objective.\nThe original T5-3B model was pretrained using a span denosing objective, while this model was pre-trained with a Bart-like MLM denosing objective.\nThe masking probability is consistent with the original T5 training by randomly masking 15% of the amino acids in the input.\n\nIt has been shown that the features extracted from this self-supervised model (LM-embeddings) captured important biophysical properties governing protein shape.\nshape.\nThis implied learning some of the grammar of the language of life realized in protein sequences.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model could be used for protein feature extraction or to be fine-tuned on downstream tasks.\nWe have noticed in some tasks on can gain more accuracy by fine-tuning the model rather than using it as a feature extractor.\nWe have also noticed that for feature extraction, its better to use the feature extracted from the encoder not from the decoder.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to extract the features of a given protein sequence in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5Model\nimport re\nimport torch\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('Rostlab/prot_t5_xl_bfd', do_lower_case=False)\n\nmodel = T5Model.from_pretrained(\"Rostlab/prot_t5_xl_bfd\")\n\nsequences_Example = [\"A E T C Z A O\",\"S K T Z P\"]\n\nsequences_Example = [re.sub(r\"[UZOB]\", \"X\", sequence) for sequence in sequences_Example]\n\nids = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(sequences_Example, add_special_tokens=True, padding=True)\n\ninput_ids = torch.tensor(ids['input_ids'])\nattention_mask = torch.tensor(ids['attention_mask'])\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    embedding = model(input_ids=input_ids,attention_mask=attention_mask,decoder_input_ids=None)\n\n# For feature extraction we recommend to use the encoder embedding\nencoder_embedding = embedding[2].cpu().numpy()\ndecoder_embedding = embedding[0].cpu().numpy()\n```\n\n## Training data\n\nThe ProtT5-XL-BFD model was pretrained on [BFD]( a dataset consisting of 2.1 billion protein sequences.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe protein sequences are uppercased and tokenized using a single space and a vocabulary size of 21. The rare amino acids \"U,Z,O,B\" were mapped to \"X\".\nThe inputs of the model are then of the form:\n\n```\nProtein Sequence [EOS]\n```\n\nThe preprocessing step was performed on the fly, by cutting and padding the protein sequences up to 512 tokens.\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sequence are as follows:\n- 15% of the amino acids are masked.\n- In 90% of the cases, the masked amino acids are replaced by `[MASK]` token.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked amino acids are replaced by a random amino acid (different) from the one they replace.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on a single TPU Pod V3-1024 for 1.2 million steps in total, using sequence length 512 (batch size 4k).\nIt has a total of approximately 3B parameters and was trained using the encoder-decoder architecture.\nThe optimizer used is AdaFactor with inverse square root learning rate schedule for pre-training.\n\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen the model is used for feature etraction, this model achieves the following results:\n\nTest results :\n\n secondary structure (3-states)   Localization \n:-----::-----:\n 77     \n 85      \n 84     \n     77 \n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article {Elnaggar2020.07.12.199554,\n\tauthor = {Elnaggar, Ahmed and Heinzinger, Michael and Dallago, Christian and Rehawi, Ghalia and Wang, Yu and Jones, Llion and Gibbs, Tom and Feher, Tamas and Angerer, Christoph and Steinegger, Martin and BHOWMIK, DEBSINDHU and Rost, Burkhard},\n\ttitle = {ProtTrans: Towards Cracking the Language of Life{\\textquoteright}s Code Through Self-Supervised Deep Learning and High Performance Computing},\n\telocation-id = {2020.07.12.199554},\n\tyear = {2020},\n\tdoi = {10.1101/2020.07.12.199554},\n\tpublisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},\n\tabstract = {Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models (LMs) taken from Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The aim of this project is to pretrain a language model using GPT-2 specifically for Tamil language. \n\n## Setup:\nTo setup the project, run the following command,\n```python\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Model:\nPretrained model on Tamil language using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective.\n \n## Dataset Used:\nThe GTP-2 model is trained on [oscar dataset - ta]( and [IndicNLP dataset - ta](\n\n## Intended uses & limitations:\nYou can use the raw model for next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub]( to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n## How to pretrain the model:\nTo perform training, do the following steps,\n\n- Export the model directory (where you want to store the model artifacts like config, tokenizer, etc.)\n```python\n>>> export MODEL_DIR=<model_dir>\n```\n- Create the config.json by running the following command,\n```python\n>>> python src/create_config.py\n```\n- Create the tokenizer by running the following command,\n```python\n>>> python src/train_tokenizer.py\n```\n- Once the config and tokenizer is created, run the following script to start training the flax model\n```python\n>>> python scripts/train_gpt2-oscar-tamil.sh\n```\n\n## How to use:\nTo perform language generation using the model, pipeline can be used directly.\n\n- First convert the flax model to pytorch using the following command,\n```python\npython src/convert_flax_to_pytorch.py\n```\n- Use the following snippet to perform language generation,\n```python\n >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead, pipeline\n >>> model_name = 'abinayam/gpt-2-tamil'\n >>> model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained(model_name)\n >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n >>> set_seed(42)\n >>> input_text = \"à®à®°à¯ à®à®°à®¿à®²à¯ à®à®°à¯ à®à®¾à®à¯à®à¯à®à¯à®à¯\"\n >>> max_len = 300\n >>> no_seq = 5\n >>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n >>> sequence = generator(input_text, max_length=max_len, num_return_sequences=no_seq)\n```\n",

It is intended to be used for zero-shot text classification, inspired by [xlm-roberta-large-xnli](\n\n## Intended Use\n\nThis model is intended to be used for zero-shot text classification, especially in languages other than English. It is fine-tuned on English MNLI and the [xtreme_xnli]( training set, a multilingual NLI dataset.

This means that our expected outputs will be text. During fine-tuning, the model learns to respond to the NLI task with a series of single token responses that map to entailment, neutral, or contradiction. The NLI task is indicated with a fixed prefix, \"xnli:\". \n\nBelow is an example, using PyTorch, of the model's use in a similar fashion to the `zero-shot-classification` pipeline. We use the logits from the LM output at the first token to represent confidence.\n\n```python\nfrom torch.nn.functional import softmax\nfrom transformers import MT5ForConditionalGeneration, MT5Tokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"alan-turing-institute/mt5-large-finetuned-mnli-xtreme-xnli\"\n\ntokenizer = MT5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = MT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel.eval()\n\nsequence_to_classify = \"Â¿A quiÃ©n vas a votar en 2020?\"\ncandidate_labels = [\"Europa\", \"salud pÃºblica\", \"polÃ­tica\"]\nhypothesis_template = \"Este ejemplo es {}.\"\n\nENTAILS_LABEL = \"â0\"\nNEUTRAL_LABEL = \"â1\"\nCONTRADICTS_LABEL = \"â2\"\n\nlabel_inds = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(\n    [ENTAILS_LABEL, NEUTRAL_LABEL, CONTRADICTS_LABEL])\n\n\ndef process_nli(premise: str, hypothesis: str):\n    \"\"\" process to required xnli format with task prefix \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join(['xnli: premise: ', premise, ' hypothesis: ', hypothesis])\n\n\n# construct sequence of premise, hypothesis pairs\npairs = [(sequence_to_classify, hypothesis_template.format(label)) for label in\n        candidate_labels]\n# format for mt5 xnli task\nseqs = [process_nli(premise=premise, hypothesis=hypothesis) for\n        premise, hypothesis in pairs]\nprint(seqs)\n# ['xnli: premise: Â¿A quiÃ©n vas a votar en 2020? hypothesis: Este ejemplo es Europa.',\n# 'xnli: premise: Â¿A quiÃ©n vas a votar en 2020? hypothesis: Este ejemplo es salud pÃºblica.',\n# 'xnli: premise: Â¿A quiÃ©n vas a votar en 2020? hypothesis: Este ejemplo es polÃ­tica.']\n\ninputs = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(seqs, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n\nout = model.generate(**inputs, output_scores=True, return_dict_in_generate=True,\n                     num_beams=1)\n\n# sanity check that our sequences are expected length (1 + start token + end token = 3)\nfor i, seq in enumerate(out.sequences):\n    assert len(\n        seq) == 3, f\"generated sequence {i} not of expected length, 3.\" \\\\\\\\\n                   f\" Actual length: {len(seq)}\"\n\n# get the scores for our only token of interest\n# we'll now treat these like the output logits of a `*ForSequenceClassification` model\nscores = out.scores[0]\n\n# scores has a size of the model's vocab.\n# However, for this task we have a fixed set of labels\n# sanity check that these labels are always the top 3 scoring\nfor i, sequence_scores in enumerate(scores):\n    top_scores = sequence_scores.argsort()[-3:]\n    assert set(top_scores.tolist()) == set(label_inds), \\\\\\\\\n        f\"top scoring tokens are not expected for this task.\" \\\\\\\\\n        f\" Expected: {label_inds}.

More details are available in the [AraBERT Paper]( and in the [AraBERT Meetup](\n\nThere are two versions of the model, AraBERTv0.1 and AraBERTv1, with the difference being that AraBERTv1 uses pre-segmented text where prefixes and suffixes were splitted using the [Farasa Segmenter](\n\n\nWe evalaute AraBERT models on different downstream tasks and compare them to [mBERT](( and other state of the art models (*To the extent of our knowledge*). The Tasks were Sentiment Analysis on 6 different datasets ([HARD]( [ASTD-Balanced]( [ArsenTD-Lev]( [LABR]( Named Entity Recognition with the [ANERcorp]( and Arabic Question Answering on [Arabic-SQuAD and ARCD](\n\n# AraBERTv2\n\n## What's New!\n\nAraBERT now comes in 4 new variants to replace the old v1 versions:\n\nMore Detail in the AraBERT folder and in the [README]( and in the [AraBERT Paper](\n\n Model  Size (MB/Params) DataSet (Sentences/Size/nWords) |\n ---:---::---:\nAraBERTv0.2-base  543MB / 136M  200M / 77GB / 8.6B |\n AraBERTv0.2-large 1.38G 371M  200M / 77GB / 8.6B |\nAraBERTv2-base 543MB 136M  200M / 77GB / 8.6B |\nAraBERTv2-large 1.38G 371M  200M / 77GB / 8.6B |\n AraBERTv0.1-base 543MB 136M  77M / 23GB / 2.7B |\nAraBERTv1-base 543MB 136M  77M / 23GB / 2.7B |\n\nAll models are available in the `HuggingFace` model page under the [aubmindlab]( name. Checkpoints are available in PyTorch, TF2 and TF1 formats.\n\n## Better Pre-Processing and New Vocab\n\nWe identified an issue with AraBERTv1's wordpiece vocabulary. The issue came from punctuations and numbers that were still attached to words when learned the wordpiece vocab. We now insert a space between numbers and characters and around punctuation characters.\n\nThe new vocabulary was learnt using the `BertWordpieceTokenizer` from the `tokenizers` library, and should now support the Fast tokenizer implementation from the `transformers` library.\n\n**P.S.**: All the old BERT codes should work with the new BERT, just change the model name and check the new preprocessing dunction\n**Please read the section on how to use the [preprocessing function](#Preprocessing)**\n\n## Bigger Dataset and More Compute\n\nWe used ~3.5 times more data, and trained for longer.\nFor Dataset Sources see the [Dataset Section](#Dataset)\n\nModel  num of examples with seq len (128 / 512)  512 (Batch Size/ Num of Steps)  Total Time (in Days) |\n ---:---::---::---:\nAraBERTv0.2-base  420M / 207M  384/ 2M  -\nAraBERTv0.2-large  420M / 207M  2056 / 300K  7\nAraBERTv2-base  420M / 207M  384/ 2M  -\nAraBERTv2-large  520M / 245M  2056 / 300K  7\nAraBERT-base (v1/v0.1)  -  128 / 300K 4\n\n# Dataset\n\nThe pretraining data used for the new AraBERT model is also used for Arabic **GPT2 and ELECTRA**.\n\nThe dataset consists of 77GB or 200,095,961 lines or 8,655,948,860 words or 82,232,988,358 chars (before applying Farasa Segmentation)\n\nFor the new dataset we added the unshuffled OSCAR corpus, after we thoroughly filter it, to the previous dataset used in AraBERTv1 but with out the websites that we previously crawled:\n- OSCAR unshuffled and filtered.\n- [Arabic Wikipedia dump]( from 2020/09/01\n- [The 1.5B words Arabic Corpus](\n- [The OSIAN Corpus](\n- Assafir news articles.

The authors focus on controversial topics, i.e., topics that include \"an obvious polarity to the possible outcomes\" and compile a final set of eight controversial topics: _abortion, school uniforms, death penalty, marijuana legalization, nuclear energy, cloning, gun control, and minimum wage_.\n\n ARGUMENT \n----\n 2213 \n 325 \n 325 \n 325 \n 325 \n 325 \n 325 \n 325 \n\nðð¼ââï¸**Model training**\n\n**RoBERTArg** was fine-tuned on a RoBERTA (base) pre-trained model from HuggingFace using the HuggingFace trainer with the following hyperparameters:\n\n```\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    num_train_epochs=2,\n    learning_rate=2.3102e-06,\n    seed=8,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=64,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,\n)\n```\n\nð **Evaluation**\n\nThe model was evaluated on an evaluation set (20%):\n\n Acc  R arg  P arg \n------------\n 0.8193  0.8463  0.7623 \n\nShowing the **confusion matrix** using again the evaluation set:\n\n ARGUMENT \n----\n 2213 \n 325 \n\nâ ï¸ **Intended Uses & Potential Limitations**\n\nThe model can only be a starting point to dive into the exciting field of argument mining. But be aware. An argument is a complex structure, with multiple dependencies. Therefore, the model may perform less well on different topics and text types not included in the training set.\n\nEnjoy and stay tuned! ð\n\nð¦ Twitter: [@chklamm](",

It was trained using all research paper titles and abstracts under artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (LG), computation and language (CL), and computer vision and pattern recognition (CV) on arXiv.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\n#### How to use\n\nTo generate paper abstracts, use the provided `generate.py` [here]( This is very similar to the HuggingFace's `run_generation.py` [here]( You can simply replace the text with with your own model path (line 89) and change the input string to your paper title (line 127). If you want to use your own script, make sure to prepend `<> ` at the front and append ` <>` at the end of the paper title.\n\n## Training data\nI selected a subset of the [arXiv Archive]( dataset (Geiger, 2019) as the training and evaluation data to fine-tune GPT-2. The original arXiv Archive dataset contains a full archive of metadata about papers on arxiv.org, from the start of the site in 1993 to the end of 2019. Our subset includes all the paper titles (query) and abstracts (context) under the Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computation and Language (cs.CL), and Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) categories. I provide the information  of the sub-dataset and the distribution of the training and evaluation dataset as follows.\n\n\n   Count     BPE Token Count |\n :--------:  :-------------: |\n   90,000      20,834,012    |\n    4,940       1,195,056    |\n    4,940       1,218,754    |\n **99,880**  **23,247,822**  |\n\nThe original dataset is in the format of a tab-separated value, so we wrote a simple preprocessing script to convert it into a text file format, which is the input file type (a document) of the GPT-2 model. An example of a paperâs title and its abstract is shown below.\n\n```text\n<> Some paper title <> Some paper abstract <>\n```\n\nBecause there are a lot of cross-domain papers in the dataset, I deduplicate the dataset using the arXiv ID, which is unique for every paper. I sort the paper by submission date, by doing so, one can examine GPT-2âs ability to use learned terminologies when it is prompted with paper titles from the âfuture.â\n\n\n## Training procedure\n\nI used block size = 512, batch size = 1, gradidnet accumulation = 1, learning rate = 1e-5, epochs = 5, and everything else follows the default model configuration.\n\n## Eval results\n\nThe resulting GPT-2 large model's perplexity score on the test set is **14.9413**.\n\n## Reference\n\n```bibtex\n@dataset{r_stuart_geiger_2019_2533436,\n    author= {R.

We developed this model as part of the project:\n[Train the Best Sentence Embedding Model Ever with 1B Training Pairs]( We benefited from efficient hardware infrastructure to run the project: 7 TPUs v3-8, as well\nas assistance from Googleâs Flax, JAX, and Cloud team members about efficient deep learning frameworks.\n\n## Intended uses\n\nOur model is intended to be used as a sentence encoder for a search engine. Given an input sentence, it outputs a vector which captures \nthe sentence semantic information. The sentence vector may be used for semantic-search, clustering or sentence similarity tasks.\n\n## How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text using [SentenceTransformers]( library:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('flax-sentence-embeddings/multi-qa_v1-MiniLM-L6-cls_dot')\ntext = \"Replace me by any question / answer you'd like.\"\ntext_embbedding = model.encode(text)\n# array([-0.01559514,  0.04046123,  0.1317083 ,  0.00085931,  0.04585106,\n#        -0.05607086,  0.0138078 ,  0.03569756,  0.01420381,  0.04266302 ...],\n#        dtype=float32)\n```\n\n# Training procedure\n\n## Pre-training \n\nWe use the pretrained [nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased]( Please refer to the model\ncard for more detailed information about the pre-training procedure.\n\n## Fine-tuning \n\nWe fine-tune the model using a contrastive objective. Formally, we compute the cosine similarity from each possible sentence pairs from the batch.\nWe then apply the cross entropy loss by comparing with true pairs.\n\n### Hyper parameters\n\nWe trained on model on a TPU v3-8. We train the model during 80k steps using a batch size of 1024 (128 per TPU core).\nWe use a learning rate warm up of 500. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens. We used the AdamW optimizer with\na 2e-5 learning rate. The full training script is accessible in this current repository.\n\n### Training data\n\nWe used the concatenation from multiple Stackexchange Question-Answer datasets to fine-tune our model.

The generated sentence embeddings can be utilized for Clustering, Semantic Search and other tasks. We used a pretrained [microsoft/mpnet-base]( model and trained it using Siamese Network setup and contrastive learning objective. Question and answer pairs from StackExchange was used as training data to make the model robust to Question / Answer embedding similarity. For this model, mean pooling of hidden states were used as sentence embeddings.\n\nWe developed this model during the \n[Community week using JAX/Flax for NLP & CV]( \norganized by Hugging Face. We developed this model as part of the project:\n[Train the Best Sentence Embedding Model Ever with 1B Training Pairs]( We benefited from efficient hardware infrastructure to run the project: 7 TPUs v3-8, as well\nas assistance from Googleâs Flax, JAX, and Cloud team members about efficient deep learning frameworks.\n\n## Intended uses\n\nOur model is intended to be used as a sentence encoder for a search engine. Given an input sentence, it outputs a vector which captures \nthe sentence semantic information. The sentence vector may be used for semantic-search, clustering or sentence similarity tasks.\n\n## How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text using [SentenceTransformers]( library:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('flax-sentence-embeddings/multi-qa_v1-mpnet-mean_cos')\ntext = \"Replace me by any question / answer you'd like.\"\ntext_embbedding = model.encode(text)\n# array([-0.01559514,  0.04046123,  0.1317083 ,  0.00085931,  0.04585106,\n#        -0.05607086,  0.0138078 ,  0.03569756,  0.01420381,  0.04266302 ...],\n#        dtype=float32)\n```\n\n# Training procedure\n\n## Pre-training \n\nWe use the pretrained [microsoft/mpnet-base]( Please refer to the model\ncard for more detailed information about the pre-training procedure.\n\n## Fine-tuning \n\nWe fine-tune the model using a contrastive objective. Formally, we compute the cosine similarity from each possible sentence pairs from the batch.\nWe then apply the cross entropy loss by comparing with true pairs.\n\n### Hyper parameters\n\nWe trained on model on a TPU v3-8. We train the model during 80k steps using a batch size of 1024 (128 per TPU core).\nWe use a learning rate warm up of 500. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens. We used the AdamW optimizer with\na 2e-5 learning rate. The full training script is accessible in this current repository.\n\n### Training data\n\nWe used the concatenation from multiple Stackexchange Question-Answer datasets to fine-tune our model. MSMARCO, NQ & other question-answer datasets were also used.\n\n\n Paper                                    \n:----------------------------------------:\n - \n - \n - \n [paper]( \n - \n [paper]( \n [paper]( \n [paper]( \n [paper]( \n [paper]( \n [paper]( \n - \n [paper]( \n\n",

Specifically, a\n> tall small (deep and narrow) model is generally more efficient compared to the base model. Likewise,\n> a tall base model might also generally more efficient compared to a large model. We generally find\n> that, regardless of size, even if absolute performance might increase as we continue to stack layers,\n> the relative gain of Pareto-efficiency diminishes as we increase the layers, converging at 32 to 36\n> layers. Finally, we note that our notion of efficiency here relates to any one compute dimension, i.e.,\n> params, FLOPs or throughput (speed). We report all three key efficiency metrics (number of params,\n> FLOPS and speed) and leave this decision to the practitioner to decide which compute dimension to\n> consider.\n\nTo be more precise, *model depth* is defined as the number of transformer blocks that are stacked sequentially.\nA sequence of word embeddings is therefore processed sequentially by each transformer block.\n\n## Details model architecture\n\nThis model checkpoint - **t5-efficient-small-nl40** - is of model type **Small** with the following variations:\n- **nl** is **40**\n\nIt has **310.25** million parameters and thus requires *ca.* **1240.99 MB** of memory in full precision (*fp32*)\n or  **620.5 MB** of memory in half precision (*fp16* or *bf16*).\n\nA summary of the *original* T5 model architectures can be seen here:\n\n nl (el/dl)  dm  nh \n ----  ----  ---- \n 4/4  256  4 \n 4/4  384  8 \n 6/6  512  8 \n 12/12  768  12 \n 24/24  1024  16 \n 24/24  1024  32 \n 24/24  1024  128 \n\nwhereas the following abbreviations are used:\n\n Definition |\n ---- |\n Number of transformer blocks (depth) |\n Dimension of embedding vector (output vector of transformers block) |\n Dimension of key/value projection matrix |\n Number of attention heads |\n Dimension of intermediate vector within transformer block (size of feed-forward projection matrix) | \n Number of transformer blocks in the encoder (encoder depth) | \n Number of transformer blocks in the decoder (decoder depth) | \n Signifies that attention heads are shared | \n Signifies that key-values projection matrices are tied | \n\nIf a model checkpoint has no specific, *el* or *dl* than both the number of encoder- and decoder layers correspond to *nl*.\n\n## Pre-Training\n\nThe checkpoint was pretrained on the [Colossal, Cleaned version of Common Crawl (C4)]( for 524288 steps using \nthe span-based masked language modeling (MLM) objective.\n\n## Fine-Tuning\n\n**Note**: This model is a **pretrained** checkpoint and has to be fine-tuned for practical usage.\nThe checkpoint was pretrained in English and is therefore only useful for English NLP tasks.\nYou can follow on of the following examples on how to fine-tune the model:\n\n*PyTorch*:\n\n- [Summarization](\n- [Question Answering](\n- [Text Classification]( - *Note*: You will have to slightly adapt the training example here to make it work with an encoder-decoder model.\n\n*Tensorflow*:\n\n- [Summarization](\n- [Text Classification]( - *Note*: You will have to slightly adapt the training example here to make it work with an encoder-decoder model.\n\n*JAX/Flax*:\n\n- [Summarization](\n- [Text Classification]( - *Note*: You will have to slightly adapt the training example here to make it work with an encoder-decoder model.\n\n## Downstream Performance\n\nTODO: Add table if available\n\n## Computational Complexity\n\nTODO: Add table if available\n\n## More information\n\nWe strongly recommend the reader to go carefully through the original paper **[Scale Efficiently: Insights from Pre-training and Fine-tuning Transformers]( to get a more nuanced understanding of this model checkpoint.\nAs explained in the following [issue]( checkpoints including the *sh* or *skv* \nmodel architecture variations have *not* been ported to Transformers as they are probably of limited practical usage and are lacking a more detailed description.

We show that this approach scales with model size and performs competitively with open-domain systems that explicitly retrieve answers from an external knowledge source when answering questions.

It was introduced in the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale]( by Dosovitskiy et al. and first released in [this repository]( However, the weights were converted from the [timm repository]( by Ross Wightman, who already converted the weights from JAX to PyTorch. Credits go to him. \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing ViT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. Next, the model was fine-tuned on ImageNet (also referred to as ILSVRC2012), a dataset comprising 1 million images and 1,000 classes, at a higher resolution of 384x384.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.\n\nBy pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub]( to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to classify an image of the COCO 2017 dataset into one of the 1,000 ImageNet classes:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nurl = '\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-384')\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-384')\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n# model predicts one of the 1000 ImageNet classes\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class:\", model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx])\n```\n\nCurrently, both the feature extractor and model  support PyTorch. Tensorflow and JAX/FLAX are coming soon, and the API of ViTFeatureExtractor might change.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe ViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-21k]( a dataset consisting of 14 million images and 21k classes, and fine-tuned on [ImageNet]( a dataset consisting of 1 million images and 1k classes. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here]( \n\nImages are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (224x224 during pre-training, 384x384 during fine-tuning) and normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3 hardware (8 cores). All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Pre-training resolution is 224.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nFor evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wu2020visual,\n      title={Visual Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision}, \n      author={Bichen Wu and Chenfeng Xu and Xiaoliang Dai and Alvin Wan and Peizhao Zhang and Zhicheng Yan and Masayoshi Tomizuka and Joseph Gonzalez and Kurt Keutzer and Peter Vajda},\n      year={2020},\n      eprint={2006.03677},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{deng2009imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n```",

Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{wu2020visual,\n      title={Visual Transformers: Token-based Image Representation and Processing for Computer Vision}, \n      author={Bichen Wu and Chenfeng Xu and Xiaoliang Dai and Alvin Wan and Peizhao Zhang and Zhicheng Yan and Masayoshi Tomizuka and Joseph Gonzalez and Kurt Keutzer and Peter Vajda},\n      year={2020},\n      eprint={2006.03677},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{deng2009imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n```",

We use the same Common Crawl corpus as XLM-R for pretraining. Additionally, we also use English and Arabic Wikipedia, Arabic Gigaword (Parker et al., 2011), Arabic OSCAR (Ortiz Suï¿½rez et al., 2020), Arabic News Corpus (El-Khair, 2016), and Arabic OSIAN (Zeroual et al.,2019). In total, we train with 9.2B words of Arabic text and 26.8B words of English text, more than either XLM-R (2.9B words/23.6B words) or GigaBERT v4 (Lan et al., 2020) (4.3B words/6.1B words). We build an Englishï¿½Arabic joint vocabulary using SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) with size of 128K. We additionally enforce coverage of all Arabic characters after normalization.\n\n## Pretraining Detail\n\nWe pretrain each encoder with a batch size of 2048 sequences and 512 sequence length for 250K steps from scratch roughly 1/24 the amount of pretraining compute of XLM-R. Training takes 8 RTX6000 GPUs roughly three weeks. We follow the pretraining recipe of RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and XLM-R. We omit the next sentence prediction task and use a learning rate of 2e-4, Adam optimizer, and linear warmup of 10K steps then decay linearly to 0, multilingual sampling alpha of 0.3, and the fairseq (Ott et al., 2019) implementation.\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease cite this paper for reference:\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{yarmohammadi-etal-2021-everything,\n    title = \"Everything Is All It Takes: A Multipronged Strategy for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Information Extraction\",\n    author = \"Yarmohammadi, Mahsa  and\n      Wu, Shijie  and\n      Marone, Marc  and\n      Xu, Haoran  and\n      Ebner, Seth  and\n      Qin, Guanghui  and\n      Chen, Yunmo and\n      Guo, Jialiang and\n      Harman, Craig  and\n      Murray, Kenton and\n      White, Aaron Steven  and\n      Dredze, Mark and\n      Van Durme, Benjamin\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    year = \"2021\",\n}\n```\n",

In this project, volunteers donate and validate speech using the [oficial site]( \n- [Lapsbm]( \"Falabrasil - UFPA\" is a dataset used by the Fala Brasil group to benchmark ASR systems in Brazilian Portuguese. Contains 35 speakers (10 females), each one pronouncing 20 unique sentences, totalling  700 utterances in Brazilian Portuguese. The audios were recorded in 22.05 kHz without environment control.\n- [Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)]( a massive dataset available in many languages. The MLS is based on audiobook recordings in public domain like [LibriVox]( The dataset contains a total of 6k hours of transcribed data in many languages. The set in Portuguese [used in this work]( (mostly Brazilian variant) has approximately 284 hours of speech, obtained from 55 audiobooks read by 62 speakers.\n- [Multilingual TEDx]( a collection of audio recordings from TEDx talks in 8 source languages. The Portuguese set (mostly Brazilian Portuguese variant) contains 164 hours of transcribed speech. \n- [Sidney]( (SID): contains 5,777 utterances recorded by 72 speakers (20 women) from 17 to 59 years old with fields such as place of birth, age, gender, education, and occupation;\n- [VoxForge]( is a project with the goal to build open datasets for acoustic models. The corpus contains approximately 100 speakers and 4,130 utterances of Brazilian Portuguese, with sample rates varying from 16kHz to 44.1kHz.\n\nThese datasets were combined to build a larger Brazilian Portuguese dataset. All data was used for training except Common Voice dev/test sets, that were used for validation/test respectively. We also made test sets for all the gathered datasets.\n\n  Train   Test |\n-------:------:|\n  93.9h   5.4h |\n  37.6h   9.5h |\n   0.8h   0.1h |\n 161.0h   3.7h |\n 144.2h   1.8h |\n   5.0h   1.0h |\n   2.8h   0.1h |\n 437.2h  21.6h |\n\nThe original model was fine-tuned using [fairseq]( This notebook uses a converted version of the original one.

In this project, volunteers donate and validate speech using the [oficial site]( \n- [Lapsbm]( \"Falabrasil - UFPA\" is a dataset used by the Fala Brasil group to benchmark ASR systems in Brazilian Portuguese. Contains 35 speakers (10 females), each one pronouncing 20 unique sentences, totalling  700 utterances in Brazilian Portuguese. The audios were recorded in 22.05 kHz without environment control.\n- [Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)]( a massive dataset available in many languages. The MLS is based on audiobook recordings in public domain like [LibriVox]( The dataset contains a total of 6k hours of transcribed data in many languages. The set in Portuguese [used in this work]( (mostly Brazilian variant) has approximately 284 hours of speech, obtained from 55 audiobooks read by 62 speakers.\n- [Multilingual TEDx]( a collection of audio recordings from TEDx talks in 8 source languages. The Portuguese set (mostly Brazilian Portuguese variant) contains 164 hours of transcribed speech. \n- [Sidney]( (SID): contains 5,777 utterances recorded by 72 speakers (20 women) from 17 to 59 years old with fields such as place of birth, age, gender, education, and occupation;\n- [VoxForge]( is a project with the goal to build open datasets for acoustic models. The corpus contains approximately 100 speakers and 4,130 utterances of Brazilian Portuguese, with sample rates varying from 16kHz to 44.1kHz.\n\nThese datasets were combined to build a larger Brazilian Portuguese dataset. All data was used for training except Common Voice dev/test sets, that were used for validation/test respectively. We also made test sets for all the gathered datasets.\n\n  Train   Test |\n-------:------:|\n 94.0h    5.4h |\n 37.8h    9.5h |\n 0.8h     0.1h |\n 161.0h   3.7h |\n 148.9h   1.8h |\n 7.2h     1.0h |\n 3.9h     0.1h |\n 453.6h  21.6h |\n\nThe original model was fine-tuned using [fairseq]( This notebook uses a converted version of the original one.

In this project, volunteers donate and validate speech using the [oficial site]( \n- [Lapsbm]( \"Falabrasil - UFPA\" is a dataset used by the Fala Brasil group to benchmark ASR systems in Brazilian Portuguese. Contains 35 speakers (10 females), each one pronouncing 20 unique sentences, totalling  700 utterances in Brazilian Portuguese. The audios were recorded in 22.05 kHz without environment control.\n- [Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)]( a massive dataset available in many languages. The MLS is based on audiobook recordings in public domain like [LibriVox]( The dataset contains a total of 6k hours of transcribed data in many languages. The set in Portuguese [used in this work]( (mostly Brazilian variant) has approximately 284 hours of speech, obtained from 55 audiobooks read by 62 speakers.\n- [Multilingual TEDx]( a collection of audio recordings from TEDx talks in 8 source languages. The Portuguese set (mostly Brazilian Portuguese variant) contains 164 hours of transcribed speech. \n- [Sidney]( (SID): contains 5,777 utterances recorded by 72 speakers (20 women) from 17 to 59 years old with fields such as place of birth, age, gender, education, and occupation;\n- [VoxForge]( is a project with the goal to build open datasets for acoustic models. The corpus contains approximately 100 speakers and 4,130 utterances of Brazilian Portuguese, with sample rates varying from 16kHz to 44.1kHz.\n\nThese datasets were combined to build a larger Brazilian Portuguese dataset. All data was used for training except Common Voice dev/test sets, that were used for validation/test respectively. We also made test sets for all the gathered datasets.\n\n  Train   Test |\n-------:------:|\n 94.0h    5.4h |\n 37.8h    9.5h |\n 0.8h     0.1h |\n 161.0h   3.7h |\n 148.9h   1.8h |\n 7.2h     1.0h |\n 3.9h     0.1h |\n 453.6h  21.6h |\n\nThe original model was fine-tuned using [fairseq]( This notebook uses a converted version of the original one.

In this project, volunteers donate and validate speech using the [oficial site](\n- [Lapsbm]( \"Falabrasil - UFPA\" is a dataset used by the Fala Brasil group to benchmark ASR systems in Brazilian Portuguese. Contains 35 speakers (10 females), each one pronouncing 20 unique sentences, totalling  700 utterances in Brazilian Portuguese. The audios were recorded in 22.05 kHz without environment control;\n- [Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)]( a massive dataset available in many languages. The MLS is based on audiobook recordings in public domain like [LibriVox]( The dataset contains a total of 6k hours of transcribed data in many languages. The set in Portuguese [used in this work]( (mostly Brazilian variant) has approximately 284 hours of speech, obtained from 55 audiobooks read by 62 speakers;\n- [VoxForge]( is a project with the goal to build open datasets for acoustic models. The corpus contains approximately 100 speakers and 4,130 utterances of Brazilian Portuguese, with sample rates varying from 16kHz to 44.1kHz.\n\nThese datasets were combined to build a larger Brazilian Portuguese dataset. All data was used for training except Common Voice dev/test sets, that were used for validation/test respectively. We also made test sets for all the gathered datasets.\n\n  Train   Test |\n-------:------:|\n  93.9h   5.4h |\n  37.6h   9.5h |\n   0.8h   0.1h |\n 161.0h   3.7h |\n 144.2h   1.8h |\n   5.0h   1.0h |\n   2.8h   0.1h |\n 437.2h  21.6h |\n\nThe original model was fine-tuned using [fairseq]( This notebook uses a converted version of the original one.

When using the model make sure that your speech input is also sampled at 16Khz.\n\n**Note**: This model does not have a tokenizer as it was pretrained on audio alone. In order to use this model **speech recognition**, a tokenizer should be created and the model should be fine-tuned on labeled text data.

The dataset is quite small to perform such task (the performance might not be so good as the [original work](\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\nSelf-supervised speech representation learning methods like wav2vec 2.0 and Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) leverage unlabeled speech data for pre-training and offer good representations for numerous speech processing tasks. Despite the success of these methods, they require large memory and high pre-training costs, making them inaccessible for researchers in academia and small companies. Therefore, this paper introduces DistilHuBERT, a novel multi-task learning framework to distill hidden representations from a HuBERT model directly. This method reduces HuBERT's size by 75% and 73% faster while retaining most performance in ten different tasks. Moreover, DistilHuBERT required little training time and data, opening the possibilities of pre-training personal and on-device SSL models for speech.\n\n# Usage\nSee [this blog]( for more information on how to fine-tune the model. \n",

With those two improvements, DeBERTa out perform RoBERTa on a majority of NLU tasks with 80GB training data. \n\nPlease check the [official repository]( for more details and updates.\n\nIn [DeBERTa V3]( we replaced the MLM objective with the RTD(Replaced Token Detection) objective introduced by ELECTRA for pre-training, as well as some innovations to be introduced in our upcoming paper. Compared to DeBERTa-V2,  our V3 version significantly improves the model performance in downstream tasks.  You can find a simple introduction about the model from the appendix A11 in our original [paper](  but we will provide more details in a separate write-up.\n\nThe DeBERTa V3 small model comes with 6 layers and a hidden size of 768. Its total parameter number is 143M since we use a vocabulary containing 128K tokens which introduce 98M parameters in the Embedding layer.  This model was trained using the 160GB data as DeBERTa V2.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\n\nThe Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) in its full form consists of 10657 sentences from 23 linguistics publications, expertly annotated for acceptability (grammaticality) by their original authors. The public version provided here contains 9594 sentences belonging to training and development sets, and excludes 1063 sentences belonging to a held out test set.\n\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 3e-05\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 5.0\n\n### Training results\n\n Epoch  Validation Loss \n:-----::---------------:\n 1.0    0.4051          \n 2.0    0.4455          \n 3.0    0.5755          \n 4.0    0.7188          \n 5.0    0.8047          \n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.13.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.10.0+cu111\n- Datasets 1.16.1\n- Tokenizers 0.10.3\n",

With those two improvements, DeBERTa out perform RoBERTa on a majority of NLU tasks with 80GB training data. \nPlease check the [official repository]( for more details and updates.\nIn [DeBERTa V3]( we replaced the MLM objective with the RTD(Replaced Token Detection) objective introduced by ELECTRA for pre-training, as well as some innovations to be introduced in our upcoming paper. Compared to DeBERTa-V2,  our V3 version significantly improves the model performance in downstream tasks.  You can find a simple introduction about the model from the appendix A11 in our original [paper](  but we will provide more details in a separate write-up.\nThe DeBERTa V3 small model comes with 6 layers and a hidden size of 768. Its total parameter number is 143M since we use a vocabulary containing 128K tokens which introduce 98M parameters in the Embedding layer.  This model was trained using the 160GB data as DeBERTa V2.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThe Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus is a crowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations. Given a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence, the task is to predict whether the premise entails the hypothesis (entailment), contradicts the hypothesis (contradiction), or neither (neutral). The premise sentences are gathered from ten different sources, including transcribed speech, fiction, and government reports. The authors of the benchmark use the standard test set, for which they obtained private labels from the RTE authors, and evaluate on both the matched (in-domain) and mismatched (cross-domain) section. They also uses and recommend the SNLI corpus as 550k examples of auxiliary training data.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 3e-05\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 1000\n- num_epochs: 3.0\n\n### Training results\n\n Epoch  Validation Loss \n:-----::---------------:\n 0.04   0.5241          \n 0.08   0.4629          \n 0.12   0.4704          \n 0.16   0.4383          \n 0.2    0.4652          \n 0.24   0.4234          \n 0.29   0.4825          \n 0.33   0.3985          \n 0.37   0.4084          \n 0.41   0.3850          \n 0.45   0.3855          \n 0.49   0.4122          \n 0.53   0.4009          \n 0.57   0.4136          \n 0.61   0.3869          \n 0.65   0.3911          \n 0.69   0.3880          \n 0.73   0.3907          \n 0.77   0.3686          \n 0.81   0.4008          \n 0.86   0.3716          \n 0.9    0.3594          \n 0.94   0.3595          \n 0.98   0.3577          \n 1.02   0.4080          \n 1.06   0.3919          \n 1.1    0.4346          \n 1.14   0.4105          \n 1.18   0.4133          \n 1.22   0.4062          \n 1.26   0.3972          \n 1.3    0.3713          \n 1.34   0.3717          \n 1.39   0.3826          \n 1.43   0.4155          \n 1.47   0.4224          \n 1.51   0.3832          \n 1.55   0.4179          \n 1.59   0.3969          \n 1.63   0.4000          \n 1.67   0.3853          \n 1.71   0.3924          \n 1.75   0.4177          \n 1.79   0.3877          \n 1.83   0.3961          \n 1.87   0.3791          \n 1.91   0.3877          \n 1.96   0.4022          \n 2.0    0.3837          \n 2.04   0.4644          \n 2.08   0.4919          \n 2.12   0.4870          \n 2.16   0.5038          \n 2.2    0.5232          \n 2.24   0.5192          \n 2.28   0.5215          \n 2.32   0.4604          \n 2.36   0.5162          \n 2.4    0.4886          \n 2.44   0.4921          \n 2.49   0.4917          \n 2.53   0.4789          \n 2.57   0.4997          \n 2.61   0.4748          \n 2.65   0.4840          \n 2.69   0.4889          \n 2.73   0.4820          \n 2.77   0.4857          \n 2.81   0.4836          \n 2.85   0.4859          \n 2.89   0.4853          \n 2.93   0.4946          \n 2.97   0.4851          \n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.13.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.10.0+cu111\n- Datasets 1.15.1\n- Tokenizers 0.10.3\n",

Previous studies on the prevalence of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in different populations have shown considerable variations. There are, however, few data with regard to the prevalence of MPSs in Fenno-Ugric populations or in north-eastern Europe, except for a report about Scandinavian countries. A retrospective epidemiological study of MPSs in Estonia was undertaken, and live-birth prevalence of MPS patients born between 1985 and 2006 was estimated. The live-birth prevalence for all MPS subtypes was found to be 4.05 per 100,000 live births, which is consistent with most other European studies. MPS II had the highest calculated incidence, with 2.16 per 100,000 live births (4.2 per 100,000 male live births), forming 53% of all diagnosed MPS cases, and was twice as high as in other studied European populations. The second most common subtype was MPS IIIA, with a live-birth prevalence of 1.62 in 100,000 live births. With 0.27 out of 100,000 live births, MPS VI had the third-highest live-birth prevalence. No cases of MPS I were diagnosed in Estonia, making the prevalence of MPS I in Estonia much lower than in other European populations. MPSs are the third most frequent inborn error of metabolism in Estonia after phenylketonuria and galactosemia.\"\nsample2 = \"Early Diagnosis of Classic Homocystinuria in Kuwait through Newborn Screening: A 6-Year Experience. Kuwait is a small Arabian Gulf country with a high rate of consanguinity and where a national newborn screening program was expanded in October 2014 to include a wide range of endocrine and metabolic disorders. A retrospective study conducted between January 2015 and December 2020 revealed a total of 304,086 newborns have been screened in Kuwait. Six newborns were diagnosed with classic homocystinuria with an incidence of 1:50,000, which is not as high as in Qatar but higher than the global incidence. Molecular testing for five of them has revealed three previously reported pathogenic variants in the <i>CBS</i> gene, c.969G>A, p.(Trp323Ter); c.982G>A, p.(Asp328Asn); and the Qatari founder variant c.1006C>T, p.(Arg336Cys). This is the first study to review the screening of newborns in Kuwait for classic homocystinuria, starting with the detection of elevated blood methionine and providing a follow-up strategy for positive results, including plasma total homocysteine and amino acid analyses. Further, we have demonstrated an increase in the specificity of the current newborn screening test for classic homocystinuria by including the methionine to phenylalanine ratio along with the elevated methionine blood levels in first-tier testing. Here, we provide evidence that the newborn screening in Kuwait has led to the early detection of classic homocystinuria cases and enabled the affected individuals to lead active and productive lives.\"\n#Sample 1 is from: Krabbi K, Joost K, Zordania R, Talvik I, Rein R, Huijmans JG, Verheijen FV, Ãunap K.

The training dataset distinguishes between the beginning and continuation of an entity so that if there are back-to-back entities of the same type, the model can output where the second entity begins. As in the dataset, each token will be classified as one of the following classes:\n\nAbbreviation|Description\n---------|--------------\nO        |Outside of a named entity\nB-LOC    | Beginning of a location \nI-LOC    | Inside of a location\nB-EPI    | Beginning of an epidemiologic type (e.g. \"incidence\", \"prevalence\", \"occurrence\") \nI-EPI    | Epidemiologic type that is not the beginning token. \nB-STAT   | Beginning of an epidemiologic rate\nI-STAT   | Inside of an epidemiologic rate\n\n### EpiSet Statistics\n\nBeyond any limitations due to the EpiSet4NER dataset, this model is limited in numeracy due to BERT-based model's use of subword embeddings, which is crucial for epidemiologic rate identification and limits the entity-level results. Additionally, more recent weakly supervised learning techniques could be used to improve the performance of the model without improving the underlying dataset.\n\n## Training procedure\nThis model was trained on a [AWS EC2 p3.2xlarge]( which utilized a single Tesla V100 GPU, with these hyperparameters:\n4 epochs of training (AdamW weight decay = 0.05) with a batch size of 16. Maximum sequence length = 192. Model was fed one sentence at a time.

It has created a valid left-right-scale, the rile-index, to aaggregate manifesto in a standardized, onde-dimensional political space from left to right based on saliency-theory.\nRoBERTa-RILE classifies texts based on the rile index.\n\n### Tain data\n\nTrain data was slightly imbalanced.\n\n Description \n--------------\n neutral       \n left       \n right       \n\nOverall count: 115,943\n\n### Validation data\n\nThe validation was created by chance.\n\n Description \n--------------\n neutral       \n left       \n right       \n\nOverall count: 20,461\n\n### Test data\n\nThe test dataset contains ten canadian manifestos between 2004 and 2008.\n\n Description \n--------------\n neutral       \n left       \n right       \n\nOverall count: 8,330\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n```\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    warmup_ratio=0.05,\n    weight_decay=0.1, \n    learning_rate=1e-05,\n    fp16 = True,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\",\n    num_train_epochs=5,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=16,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,\n    save_strategy=\"no\",\n    logging_dir='logs',   \n    logging_strategy= 'steps',     \n    logging_steps=10,\n    push_to_hub=True,\n    hub_strategy=\"end\")\n```\n\n### Training results\n\n Epoch  Validation Loss  F1-micro  F1-weighted  Recall |\n:-----::---------------::--------::-----------::------:|\n 1.0    0.6827           0.7120    0.7126       0.7120 |\n 2.0    0.6618           0.7281    0.7281       0.7281 |\n 3.0    0.6657           0.7309    0.7295       0.7309 |\n 4.0    0.6654           0.7346    0.7345       0.7346 |\n 5.0    0.6757           0.7350    0.7347       0.7350 |\n\n### Validation evaluation\n\n Micro F1-Score  Weighted F1-Score |\n-----------------------------------|\n  0.74            0.73             |\n\n### Test evaluation\n\n Micro F1-Score  Weighted F1-Score |\n-----------------------------------|\n 0.69            0.69              |\n\n### Evaluation per category\n\n Validation F1-Score \n---------------------\n 0.77                \n 0.73                \n 0.67                \n\n### Evaluation based on saliency theory\n\nSaliency theory is a theory to analyse politial text data. In sum, parties tend to write about policies in which they think that they are seen as competent.\nVoters tend to assign advantages in policy competence in line to the assumed ideology of parties. Therefore you can analyze the share of policies parties tend to write about in their manifestos to analyze the party ideology.\n\nThe Manifesto Project presented for such an analysis the rile-index. For a quick overview, check [this](\n\nIn the following plot, the predicted and original rile-indices are shown per manifesto in the test dataset. Overall the pearson correlation between the predicted and original rile-indices is 0.95. As alternative, you can use [ManiBERT](\n\n![image](english_robertarile_manifesto.png)\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.16.2\n- Pytorch 1.9.0+cu102\n- Datasets 1.8.0\n- Tokenizers 0.10.3\n",

The model detailed here serves as a foundation for traditional classification models as well as NLU models for a Psych-Search application. The goal of the Psych-Search Application is to use a combination of traditional text classification models to expand the scope of the MESH taxonomy with the inclusion of relevant categories for mental health pracitioners designing suicide prevention programs for adolescent communities within the United States, as well as the automatic extraction and standardization of entities such as risk factors and protective factors.\n\nOur first expansion efforts to the MESH taxonomy include categories:\n- Prevention Strategies\n- Protective Factors\n\nWe are actively looking for partners on this work and would love to hear from you! Please ping us at nlp4good@gmail.com. \n\n## Model description\n\nThis model is an extension of [allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased]( Continued pretraining was done using SciBERT as the base model using abstract text only from Pyschology and Psychiatry PubMed research. Training was done on approximately 3.5 million papers for 10 epochs and evaluated on a task similar to BioASQ Task A.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\n#### How to use\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\n\nmname = \"nlp4good/psych-search\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(mname)\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(mname)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThis model was trained on all PubMed abstracts categorized under [Psychology and Psychiatry]( As of March 1, this corresponds to approximately 3.2 million papers that contains abstract text. Of these 3.2 million papers, relevant sparse mental health categories were back translated to increase the representation of certain mental health categories.\n\nThere are several limitation with this dataset including large discrepancies in the number of papers associated with [Sexual and Gender Minorities]( The training data consisted of the following breakdown across gender groups:\n\nFemale  Sexual and Gender Minorities\n-----------------\n1,896,301  4,529\n\nSimilar discrepancies are present within [Ethnic Groups]( as defined within the MESH taxonomy:\n\n Arabs  Hispanic Americans  Indians, North American  Indigenous Peoples \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 2,437  18,893              5,657                    174                \n\nThese discrepancies can have a significant impact on information retrieval systems, downstream  machine learning models, and other forms of NLP that leverage these pretrained models.\n## Training data\n\nThis model was trained on all PubMed abstracts categorized under [Psychology and Psychiatry]( As of March 1, this corresponds to approximately 3.2 million papers that contains abstract text. Of these 3.2 million papers, relevant sparse categories were back translated from english to french and from french to english to increase the representation of sparser mental health categories. This included backtranslating the following papers with the following categories:\n- Depressive Disorder\n- Risk Factors\n- Mental Disorders\n- Child, Preschool\n- Mental Health\n\nIn aggregate, this process added 557,980 additional papers to our training data. \n\n\n## Training procedure\nContinued pretraining was done on Psychology and Psychiatry PubMed papers for 10 epochs. Default parameters were used with the exception of gradient accumulation steps which was set at 4, with a per device train batch size of 32. 2 x Nvidia 3090's were used in the development of this model. \n\n\n## Evaluation results\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of psych-search within the mental health domain, an evaluation task was constructed by finetuning psych-search for a task similar to [BioASQ Task A]( Here we perform large scale biomedical indexing using the MESH taxonomy associated with each paper underneath Psychology and Psychiatry. The evaluation metric is the micro F1 score across all second level descriptors within Psychology and Psychiatry. This corresponds to 38 different MESH categories used during evaluation.\n\nbert-base-uncased    Psych-Search\n-----------------\n0.7348   0.7415\n\n## Next Steps\nIf you are interested in continuing to build on this work or have other ideas on how we can build on others work, please let us know! We can be reached at nlp4good@gmail.com. Our goal is to bring state of the art NLP capabilities to underserved areas of research, with mental health being our top priority.",

The annotation was elaborated with further entity subtypes not present in the Ontonotes 5 annotation (see below).\n\n## Tags derived from the OntoNotes 5.0 annotation\n\nNames are annotated according to the following set of types:\n\n | \n---------|\n = PERSON People, including fictional |\n = FACILITY Buildings, airports, highways, bridges, etc. |\n = ORGANIZATION Companies, agencies, institutions, etc. |\n Geopolitical entites: countries, cities, states |\n = LOCATION Non-GPE locations, mountain ranges, bodies of water |\n = PRODUCT Vehicles, weapons, foods, etc. (Not services) |\n Named hurricanes, battles, wars, sports events, etc. |\n Titles of books, songs, etc. |\n Named documents made into laws  |\n\nThe following are also annotated in a style similar to names:\n\n | \n---------|\n Nationalities or religious or political groups |\n Any named language |\n Absolute or relative dates or periods |\n Times smaller than a day |\n Percentage (including \"%\") |\n Monetary values, including unit |\n Measurements, as of weight or distance |\n \"first\", \"second\" |\n Numerals that do not fall under another type |\n\n## Additional tags (not in OntoNotes 5)\nFurther subtypes of names of type `MISC`:\n\n |\n-|\n Awards and prizes |\n Cars and other motor vehicles |\n Media outlets, TV channels, news portals|\n Social media platforms|\n Projects and initiatives |\n Unresolved subtypes of MISC entities |\n Organization-like unresolved subtypes of MISC entities |\n\nFurther non-name entities:\n\n |\n-|\nTime duration\nAge\n Identifier\n\n### If you use this model, please cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{novak-novak-2022-nerkor,\n    title = \"{N}er{K}or+{C}ars-{O}nto{N}otes++\",\n    author = \"Nov{\\'a}k, Attila  and\n      Nov{\\'a}k, Borb{\\'a}la\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference\",\n    month = jun,\n    year = \"2022\",\n    address = \"Marseille, France\",\n    publisher = \"European Language Resources Association\",\n    url = \"\n    pages = \"1907--1916\",\n    abstract = \"In this paper, we present an upgraded version of the Hungarian NYTK-NerKor named entity corpus, which contains about twice as many annotated spans and 7 times as many distinct entity types as the original version. We used an extended version of the OntoNotes 5 annotation scheme including time and numerical expressions. NerKor is the newest and biggest NER corpus for Hungarian containing diverse domains. We applied cross-lingual transfer of NER models trained for other languages based on multilingual contextual language models to preannotate the corpus. We corrected the annotation semi-automatically and manually. Zero-shot preannotation was very effective with about 0.82 F1 score for the best model. We also added a 12000-token subcorpus on cars and other motor vehicles. We trained and release a transformer-based NER tagger for Hungarian using the annotation in the new corpus version, which provides similar performance to an identical model trained on the original version of the corpus.\",\n}\n```",

The model was also developed to test the ability of models to generalize to arbitrary image classification tasks in a zero-shot manner. It was not developed for general model deployment - to deploy models like CLIP, researchers will first need to carefully study their capabilities in relation to the specific context theyâre being deployed within.\n\n\n### Model Date\nJanuary 2021\n\n\n### Model Type\nThe base model uses a ViT-B/16 Transformer architecture as an image encoder and uses a masked self-attention Transformer as a text encoder. These encoders are trained to maximize the similarity of (image, text) pairs via a contrastive loss.\n\nThe original implementation had two variants: one using a ResNet image encoder and the other using a Vision Transformer. This repository has the variant with the Vision Transformer.\n\n\n### Documents\n- [Blog Post](\n- [CLIP Paper](\n\n\n### Use with Transformers\n```python3\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch16\")\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch16\")\nurl = \"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\ninputs = processor(text=[\"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a dog\"], images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image # this is the image-text similarity score\nprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1) # we can take the softmax to get the label probabilities\n```\n\n\n## Model Use\n\n### Intended Use\nThe model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, arbitrary image classification. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models - the CLIP paper includes a discussion of potential downstream impacts to provide an example for this sort of analysis.\n\n\n#### Primary intended uses\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers.\nWe primarily imagine the model will be used by researchers to better understand robustness, generalization, and other capabilities, biases, and constraints of computer vision models.\n\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use Cases\n**Any** deployed use case of the model - whether commercial or not - is currently out of scope. Non-deployed use cases such as image search in a constrained environment, are also not recommended unless there is thorough in-domain testing of the model with a specific, fixed class taxonomy. This is because our safety assessment demonstrated a high need for task specific testing especially given the variability of CLIPâs performance with different class taxonomies. This makes untested and unconstrained deployment of the model in any use case currently potentially harmful. \nCertain use cases which would fall under the domain of surveillance and facial recognition are always out-of-scope regardless of performance of the model. This is because the use of artificial intelligence for tasks such as these can be premature currently given the lack of testing norms and checks to ensure its fair use.\nSince the model has not been purposefully trained in or evaluated on any languages other than English, its use should be limited to English language use cases.\n\n\n## Data\nThe model was trained on publicly available image-caption data. This was done through a combination of crawling a handful of websites and using commonly-used pre-existing image datasets such as [YFCC100M]( A large portion of the data comes from our crawling of the internet. This means that the data is more representative of people and societies most connected to the internet which tend to skew towards more developed nations, and younger, male users.\n\n\n### Data Mission Statement\nOur goal with building this dataset was to test out robustness and generalizability in computer vision tasks. As a result, the focus was on gathering large quantities of data from different publicly-available internet data sources. The data was gathered in a mostly non-interventionist manner. However, we only crawled websites that had policies against excessively violent and adult images and allowed us to filter out such content. We do not intend for this dataset to be used as the basis for any commercial or deployed model and will not be releasing the dataset.\n\n\n## Performance and Limitations\n\n\n### Performance\nWe have evaluated the performance of CLIP on a wide range of benchmarks across a variety of computer vision datasets such as OCR to texture recognition to fine-grained classification. The paper describes model performance on the following datasets:\n- Food101\n- CIFAR10   \n- CIFAR100   \n- Birdsnap\n- SUN397\n- Stanford Cars\n- FGVC Aircraft\n- VOC2007\n- DTD\n- Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset\n- Caltech101\n- Flowers102\n- MNIST   \n- SVHN \n- IIIT5K   \n- Hateful Memes   \n- SST-2\n- UCF101\n- Kinetics700\n- Country211\n- CLEVR Counting\n- KITTI Distance\n- STL-10\n- RareAct\n- Flickr30\n- MSCOCO\n- ImageNet\n- ImageNet-A\n- ImageNet-R\n- ImageNet Sketch\n- ObjectNet (ImageNet Overlap)\n- Youtube-BB\n- ImageNet-Vid\n\n\n## Limitations\nCLIP and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. CLIP currently struggles with respect to certain tasks such as fine grained classification and counting objects. CLIP also poses issues with regards to fairness and bias which we discuss in the paper and briefly in the next section. Additionally, our approach to testing CLIP also has an important limitation- in many cases we have used linear probes to evaluate the performance of CLIP and there is evidence suggesting that linear probes can underestimate model performance.\n\n\n### Bias and Fairness\nWe find that the performance of CLIP - and the specific biases it exhibits - can depend significantly on class design and the choices one makes for categories to include and exclude. We tested the risk of certain kinds of denigration with CLIP by classifying images of people from [Fairface]( into crime-related and non-human animal categories. We found significant disparities with respect to race and gender. Additionally, we found that these disparities could shift based on how the classes were constructed. (Details captured in the Broader Impacts Section in the paper).\nWe also tested the performance of CLIP on gender, race and age classification using the Fairface dataset (We default to using race categories as they are constructed in the Fairface dataset.) in order to assess quality of performance across different demographics. We found accuracy >96% across all races for gender classification with âMiddle Easternâ having the highest accuracy (98.4%) and âWhiteâ having the lowest (96.5%). Additionally, CLIP averaged ~93% for racial classification and ~63% for age classification. Our use of evaluations to test for gender, race and age classification as well as denigration harms is simply to evaluate performance of the model across people and surface potential risks and not to demonstrate an endorsement/enthusiasm for such tasks.\n\n\n## Feedback\n\n\n### Where to send questions or comments about the model\nPlease use [this Google Form](\n",

When using the model\nmake sure that your speech input is also sampled at 16Khz.\n\n[Paper](\n\nAuthors: Alexei Baevski, Henry Zhou, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Michael Auli\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWe show for the first time that learning powerful representations from speech audio alone followed by fine-tuning on transcribed speech can outperform the best semi-supervised methods while being conceptually simpler. wav2vec 2.0 masks the speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent representations which are jointly learned. Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the clean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state of the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data. Using just ten minutes of labeled data and pre-training on 53k hours of unlabeled data still achieves 4.8/8.2 WER. This demonstrates the feasibility of speech recognition with limited amounts of labeled data.\n\nThe original model can be found under \n\n\n# Usage\n\nTo transcribe audio files the model can be used as a standalone acoustic model as follows:\n\n```python\n from transformers import Wav2Vec2Tokenizer, Wav2Vec2ForCTC\n from datasets import load_dataset\n import soundfile as sf\n import torch\n \n # load model and tokenizer\n tokenizer = Wav2Vec2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\n model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\n \n # define function to read in sound file\n def map_to_array(batch):\n     speech, _ = sf.read(batch[\"file\"])\n     batch[\"speech\"] = speech\n     return batch\n     \n # load dummy dataset and read soundfiles\n ds = load_dataset(\"patrickvonplaten/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n ds = ds.map(map_to_array)\n \n # tokenize\n input_values = tokenizer(ds[\"speech\"][:2], return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=\"longest\").input_values  # Batch size 1\n \n # retrieve logits\n logits = model(input_values).logits\n \n # take argmax and decode\n predicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)\n transcription = tokenizer.batch_decode(predicted_ids)\n ```\n \n ## Evaluation\n \n This code snippet shows how to evaluate **facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h** on LibriSpeech's \"clean\" and \"other\" test data.\n \n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Tokenizer\nimport soundfile as sf\nimport torch\nfrom jiwer import wer\n\n\nlibrispeech_eval = load_dataset(\"librispeech_asr\", \"clean\", split=\"test\")\n\nmodel = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\").to(\"cuda\")\ntokenizer = Wav2Vec2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\n\ndef map_to_array(batch):\n    speech, _ = sf.read(batch[\"file\"])\n    batch[\"speech\"] = speech\n    return batch\n\nlibrispeech_eval = librispeech_eval.map(map_to_array)\n\ndef map_to_pred(batch):\n    input_values = tokenizer(batch[\"speech\"], return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=\"longest\").input_values\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        logits = model(input_values.to(\"cuda\")).logits\n\n    predicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)\n    transcription = tokenizer.batch_decode(predicted_ids)\n    batch[\"transcription\"] = transcription\n    return batch\n\nresult = librispeech_eval.map(map_to_pred, batched=True, batch_size=1, remove_columns=[\"speech\"])\n\nprint(\"WER:\", wer(result[\"text\"], result[\"transcription\"]))\n```\n\n*Result (WER)*:\n\n \"other\" |\n---|\n 8.6 |",

Lâobjectiu Ãºltim Ã©s que la ciutadania pugui participar en catalÃ  en el mÃ³n digital al mateix nivell que els parlants dâuna llengua global, com ara lâanglÃ¨s, i evitar aixÃ­ lâextinciÃ³ digital de la llengua. El primer recurs generat Ã©s el corpus del catalÃ  per entrenar els algoritmes dâintelÂ·ligÃ¨ncia artificial (IA), el mÃ©s gran creat fins al moment, amb 1.770 milions de metadades associades a paraules. El proper pas serÃ  generar els models de la llengua, models de la parla i models de traducciÃ³ utilitzant xarxes neuronals multicapa, perquÃ¨ les empreses que creen aplicacions basades en intelÂ·ligÃ¨ncia artificial (IA), com ara assistents de veu, traductors automÃ tics, agents conversacionals, etc., puguin fer-ho fÃ cilment en catalÃ .\"\n- text: \"El Govern vol que el catalÃ  tambÃ© sigui una llengua Ãºtil per a la tecnologia i per comunciar-se amb les mÃ quines. Per aixÃ², el projecte AINA, impulsat pel Departament de la VicepresidÃ¨ncia, PolÃ­tiques Digitals i Territori en colÂ·laboraciÃ³ amb el Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), llanÃ§arÃ  el 17 de febrer una campanya de captaciÃ³ de veus per generar el primer corpus o \\\"diccionari\\\" de veu del catalÃ  amb l'objectiu de fer que la tecnologia parli i entengui el catalÃ  i la ciutadania s'hi pugui relacionar amb aquesta llengua. Per a l'executiu, aquest projecte Ã©s d'una \\\"importÃ ncia cabdal\\\", com ha detallat el vicepresident, Jordi PuignerÃ³, tambÃ© per reforÃ§ar la llengua catalana a Internet. El pressupost que s'hi destinarÃ  aquest any Ã©s de tres milions d'euros. Per aixÃ², amb el lema \\\"La nostra llengua Ã©s la teva veu\\\", convida la ciutadania de totes les variants dialectals del catalÃ  ha compartir la seva veu mitjanÃ§ant la lectura d'uns textos. La fita que s'ha marcat AINA per aquest any Ã©s la creaciÃ³ de la primera versiÃ³ d'aquest diccionari de veus en catalÃ , amb \\\"com mÃ©s hores de veu i com mÃ©s diverses millor\\\". El Govern confia en una bona resposta a la campanya, que arrencarÃ  a partir de demÃ , i que es desplegarÃ  per tot el territori de parla catalana, per comptar amb diverses variants dialectals. No hi ha limitaciÃ³ d'edat per a qui vulgui participar, i Ã©s important que la gent que participi es registri per obtenir mÃ©s informaciÃ³ sobre genere, edat i distribuciÃ³ geogrÃ fica. Ara com ara hi ha 1.000 hores de veu i el repte Ã©s aconseguir arribar a les 2.000 (amb transcripciÃ³) aquest any. El vicepresident i conseller de PolÃ­tiques Digitals, Jordi PuignerÃ³, ha recordat que fa un any es va donar el tret de sortida al projecte AINA, una aposta per a l'Ãºs del catalÃ  en l'Ã mbit tecnolÃ²gic. El projecte implica un impuls del catalÃ  en les eines digitals i per \\\"conquerir nous territoris\\\", que passen per noves plataformes i nous dispositius. TambÃ© Ã©s un projecte per \\\"garantir drets\\\". \\\"Els catalanes tenim dret a poder relacionar-nos en catalÃ  amb les maquines i evitar haver de canviar de llengua a l'hora de parlar amb les maquines\\\", ha remarcat PuignerÃ³. Un altre objectiu d'aquest projecte passa per \\\"generar talent digital\\\" i un ecosistema en l'Ã mbit de la intelÂ·ligÃ¨ncia artificial. \\\"Ens toca ser un paÃ­s digital\\\", ha insistit PuignerÃ³. I per quÃ¨ AINA? \\\"La filla de la Norma, que porta el nom de la seva Ã via, Aina Moll, la primera directora de polÃ­tica lingÃ¼Ã­stica de la Generalitat\\\", ha explicat el vicepresident. Per tot plegat, aquest dimecres arrenca la campanya de captaciÃ³ de veus. \\\"Volem socialitzar AINA cap a la ciutadania i que molta gent vulgui ser la seva parella lingÃ¼Ã­stica i pugui aprendre el catalÃ \\\", ha dit PuignerÃ³, que ha demanat que aquesta sigui una tasca de tots. El projecte, a dia d'avui, ja coneix la sintaxis del catalÃ . En aquesta nova fase, a partir de demÃ , tambÃ© ha de conÃ¨ixer el lÃ¨xic i la semÃ ntica, i tota la part oral de la llengua catalana. \\\"Si ja tenim la columna vertebral i l'esquelet, ara hem de construir la seva musculatura\\\", ha apuntat el vicepresident. La campanya es farÃ  a travÃ©s d'una web que permetrÃ  que qualsevol persona pugui ensenyar a AINA a aprendre catalÃ . I com es pot fer? Ãs senzill. A partir que arrenqui la campanya, qui estigui interessat en colÂ·laborar haurÃ  d'entrar a  i anar a l'espai corresponent. Un cop allÃ , haurÃ  de destinar una estona a llegir frases que li proposarÃ  la plataforma i podrÃ  validar tambÃ© frases d'altres persones.\"\ndatasets:\n- projecte-aina/casum\n---\n## BART-Ca fine-tuned on the CaSum dataset for summarization\n\n## Table of Contents\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\n- [Model description](#model-description)\n- [Intended uses and limitations](#intended-use)\n- [How to use](#how-to-use)\n- [Limitations and bias](#limitations-and-bias)\n- [Training](#training)\n  - [Training data](#training-data)\n  - [Training procedure](#training-procedure)\n    - [Tokenization](#tokenization)\n    - [Hyperparameters](#hyperparameters)\n- [Evaluation](#evaluation)\n   - [Variable and metrics](#variable-and-metrics)\n   - [Evaluation results](#evaluation-results)\n- [Additional information](#additional-information)\n  - [Author](#author)\n  - [Contact information](#contact-information)\n  - [Copyright](#copyright)\n  - [Licensing information](#licensing-information)\n  - [Funding](#funding)\n  - [Citing information](#citing-information)\n  - [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n</details>\n\n## Model description\n\nThe [BART-ca]( model has been fine-tuned on summarization with the [CaSum]( dataset that has been created along with the model.

It is more appropriate to use `[MASK]` after tokenization (as it is consistent with how the model was pretrained). However, the Huggingface Inference API only supports typing `[MASK]` in the input string and produces less robust predictions.\n\n## Note 3: Provide `position_ids` as an argument explicitly\n\nWhen `position_ids` are not provided for a `Roberta*` model, Huggingface's `transformers` will automatically construct it but start from `padding_idx` instead of `0` (see [issue]( and function `create_position_ids_from_input_ids()` in Huggingface's [implementation]( which unfortunately does not work as expected with `rinna/japanese-roberta-base` since the `padding_idx` of the corresponding tokenizer is not `0`. So please be sure to constrcut the `position_ids` by yourself and make it start from position id `0`.\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example by to illustrate how our model works as a masked language model. Notice the difference between running the following code example and running the Huggingface Inference API. \n\n~~~~\n# original text\ntext = \"4å¹´ã«1åº¦ãªãªã³ããã¯ã¯éãããã\"\n\n# prepend [CLS]\ntext = \"[CLS]\" + text\n\n# tokenize\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\nprint(tokens)  # output: ['[CLS]', 'â4', 'å¹´ã«', '1', 'åº¦', 'ãªãªã³ããã¯', 'ã¯', 'éããã', 'ã']\n\n# mask a token\nmasked_idx = 5\ntokens[masked_idx] = tokenizer.mask_token\nprint(tokens)  # output: ['[CLS]', 'â4', 'å¹´ã«', '1', 'åº¦', '[MASK]', 'ã¯', 'éããã', 'ã']\n\n# convert to ids\ntoken_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)\nprint(token_ids)  # output: [4, 1602, 44, 24, 368, 6, 11, 21583, 8]\n\n# convert to tensor\nimport torch\ntoken_tensor = torch.LongTensor([token_ids])\n\n# provide position ids explicitly\nposition_ids = list(range(0, token_tensor.size(1)))\nprint(position_ids)  # output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nposition_id_tensor = torch.LongTensor([position_ids])\n\n# get the top 10 predictions of the masked token\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(input_ids=token_tensor, position_ids=position_id_tensor)\n    predictions = outputs[0][0, masked_idx].topk(10)\n\nfor i, index_t in enumerate(predictions.indices):\n    index = index_t.item()\n    token = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([index])[0]\n    print(i, token)\n\n\"\"\"\n0 ç·ä¼\n1 ãµããã\n2 ã¯ã¼ã«ãã«ãã\n3 ãã§ã¹ãã£ãã«\n4 å¤§ä¼\n5 ãªãªã³ããã¯\n6 å¨å½å¤§ä¼\n7 åå¤§ä¼\n8 ã¤ãã³ã\n9 ä¸çé¸ææ¨©\n\"\"\"\n~~~~\n\n# Model architecture\nA 12-layer, 768-hidden-size transformer-based masked language model.\n\n# Training\nThe model was trained on [Japanese CC-100]( and [Japanese Wikipedia]( to optimize a masked language modelling objective on 8*V100 GPUs for around 15 days.

This might mean there is a real limit to the number of entirely original strings this will generate.\nThis is also only based on the 117M parameter GPT2, it's a pretty obvious upgrade to retrain with medium, large or XL models. However, despite this, the outputs I tested were very convincing!\n\n## Training data\n\nThe data was 29222 MtG card flavour texts. The model was based on the \"gpt2\" pretrained transformer: \n\n## Training procedure\n\nOnly English language MtG flavour texts were scraped from the [Scryfall]( API. Empty strings and any non-UTF-8 encoded tokens were removed leaving 29222 entries.\nThis was trained using google Colab with a T4 instance. 4 epochs, adamW optimizer with default parameters and a batch size of 32. Token embedding lengths were capped at 98 tokens as this was the longest string and an attention mask was added to the training model to ignore all padding tokens.\n\n## Eval results\n\nAverage Training Loss: 0.44866578806635815.\nValidation loss: 0.5606984243444775.\n\nSample model outputs:\n\n1. \"Every branch a crossroads, every vine a swift steed.\"\n\tâGwendlyn Di Corci\n\n2. \"The secrets of this world will tell their masters where to strike if need be.\"\n\tâNoyan Dar, Tazeem roilmage\n\n3. \"The secrets of nature are expensive. You'd be better off just to have more freedom.\"\n\n4. \"Even the Dwarves knew to leave some stones unturned.\"\n\n5. \"The wise always keep an ear open to the whispers of power.\"\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{BownesLM,\n  title={Fine Tuning GPT-2 for Magic the Gathering flavour text generation.},\n  author={Richard J.

It achieves the best performance by a wide margin in intrinsic evaluation, and also the best performance in extrinsic evaluation through dependency parsing. In addition to these fine-tuned models, we also release the source files on [GitHub]( and an interactive demo on [Google Colab](\n\n\n## How to use\n\nThe model was *not* fine-tuned in a standard sentence-to-sentence setting â instead, it was tailored to the token-to-token definition of MultiLexNorm data.

The pre-training objective for the model is to predict visual tokens from the encoder of a discrete VAE (dVAE), based on masked patches.\n\nImages are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded.

The model has been fine-tuned with 275.6 hours of Finnish transcribed speech data. Wav2Vec2 XLS-R was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released at [this page](\n\nThis repository also includes Finnish KenLM language model used in the decoding phase with the acoustic model.\n\n**Note**: this model is exactly the same as the [aapot/wav2vec2-xlsr-1b-finnish-lm-v2]( model so that model has just been copied/moved to this `Finnish-NLP` Hugging Face organization.\n\n## Model description\n\nWav2Vec2 XLS-R is Facebook AI's large-scale multilingual pretrained model for speech. It is pretrained on 436k hours of unlabeled speech, including VoxPopuli, MLS, CommonVoice, BABEL, and VoxLingua107. It uses the wav2vec 2.0 objective, in 128 languages.\n\nYou can read more about the pretrained model from [this blog]( and [this paper](\n\nThis model is fine-tuned version of the pretrained model (1 billion parameter variant) for Finnish ASR.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use this model for Finnish ASR (speech-to-text) task. \n\n### How to use\n\nCheck the [run-finnish-asr-models.ipynb]( notebook in this repository for an detailed example on how to use this model.\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThis model was fine-tuned with audio samples which maximum length was 20 seconds so this model most likely works the best for quite short audios of similar length. However, you can try this model with a lot longer audios too and see how it works. If you encounter out of memory errors with very long audio files you can use the audio chunking method introduced in [this blog post](\n\nA vast majority of the data used for fine-tuning was from the Finnish Parliament dataset so this model may not generalize so well to very different domains like common daily spoken Finnish with dialects etc. In addition, audios of the datasets tend to be adult male dominated so this model may not work as well for speeches of children and women, for example.\n\nThe Finnish KenLM language model used in the decoding phase has been trained with text data from the audio transcriptions and from a subset of Finnish Wikipedia. Thus, the decoder's language model may not generalize to very different language, for example to spoken daily language with dialects (because especially the Wikipedia contains mostly formal Finnish language). It may be beneficial to train your own KenLM language model for your domain language and use that in the decoding.\n\n## Training data\n\nThis model was fine-tuned with 275.6 hours of Finnish transcribed speech data from following datasets:\n\n Hours    \n:--------:\n 9.70 h   \n 0.24 h   \n 21.97 h  \n 10.32 h  \n 228.00 h \n 5.37 h   \n\nDatasets were filtered to include maximum length of 20 seconds long audio samples.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nThis model was trained during [Robust Speech Challenge Event]( organized by Hugging Face. Training was done on a Tesla V100 GPU, sponsored by OVHcloud.\n\nTraining script was provided by Hugging Face and it is available [here]( We only modified its data loading for our custom datasets.\n\nFor the KenLM language model training, we followed the [blog post tutorial]( provided by Hugging Face. Training data for the 5-gram KenLM were text transcriptions of the audio training data and 100k random samples of cleaned [Finnish Wikipedia]( (August 2021) dataset.\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-05\n- train_batch_size: 32\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: [8-bit Adam]( with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 500\n- num_epochs: 10\n- mixed_precision_training: Native AMP\n\nThe pretrained `facebook/wav2vec2-xls-r-1b` model was initialized with following hyperparameters:\n- attention_dropout: 0.094\n- hidden_dropout: 0.047\n- feat_proj_dropout: 0.04\n- mask_time_prob: 0.082\n- layerdrop: 0.041\n- activation_dropout: 0.055\n- ctc_loss_reduction: \"mean\"\n\n### Training results\n\n Epoch  Validation Loss \n:-----::---------------:\n 0.17   0.2851          \n 0.34   0.1595          \n 0.5    0.1458          \n 0.67   0.1374          \n 0.84   0.1390          \n 1.01   0.1266          \n 1.17   0.1441          \n 1.34   0.1232          \n 1.51   0.1209          \n 1.68   0.1149          \n 1.84   0.1121          \n 2.01   0.1091          \n 2.18   0.1115          \n 2.35   0.1144          \n 2.51   0.1028          \n 2.68   0.1129          \n 2.85   0.1025          \n 3.02   0.1068          \n 3.18   0.1072          \n 3.35   0.0928          \n 3.52   0.1042          \n 3.69   0.0979          \n 3.85   0.0947          \n 4.02   0.0991          \n 4.19   0.0919          \n 4.36   0.0888          \n 4.52   0.0888          \n 4.69   0.0894          \n 4.86   0.0917          \n 5.03   0.0942          \n 5.19   0.0902          \n 5.36   0.0871          \n 5.53   0.0861          \n 5.7    0.0876          \n 5.86   0.0848          \n 6.03   0.0914          \n 6.2    0.0841          \n 6.37   0.0858          \n 6.53   0.0874          \n 6.7    0.0835          \n 6.87   0.0835          \n 7.04   0.0852          \n 7.21   0.0832          \n 7.37   0.0829          \n 7.54   0.0822          \n 7.71   0.0819          \n 7.88   0.0787          \n 8.04   0.0807          \n 8.21   0.0784          \n 8.38   0.0772          \n 8.55   0.0772          \n 8.71   0.0763          \n 8.88   0.0756          \n 9.05   0.0771          \n 9.22   0.0756          \n 9.38   0.0741          \n 9.55   0.0739          \n 9.72   0.0756          \n 9.89   0.0737          \n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.17.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.10.2+cu102\n- Datasets 1.18.3\n- Tokenizers 0.11.0\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nEvaluation was done with the [Common Voice 7.0 Finnish test split]( [Common Voice 9.0 Finnish test split]( and with the [FLEURS ASR Finnish test split]( \n\nThis model's training data includes the training splits of Common Voice 7.0 but our newer `Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-base-fi-voxpopuli-v2-finetuned` and `Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-large-uralic-voxpopuli-v2-finnish` models include the Common Voice 9.0 so we ran tests for both Common Voice versions. Note: Common Voice doesn't seem to fully preserve the test split as fixed between the dataset versions so it is possible that some of the training examples of Common Voice 9.0 are in the test split of the Common Voice 7.0 and vice versa. Thus, Common Voice test result comparisons are not fully accurate between the models trained with different Common Voice versions but the comparison should still be meaningful enough.\n\n### Common Voice 7.0 testing\n\nTo evaluate this model, run the `eval.py` script in this repository:\n\n```bash\npython3 eval.py --model_id Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-xlsr-1b-finnish-lm-v2  --dataset mozilla-foundation/common_voice_7_0 --config fi --split test\n```\n\nThis model (the fift row of the table) achieves the following WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate) results compared to our other models and their parameter counts:\n\n Model parameters  WER (without LM)  CER (without LM) |\n------------------------------------------------------|\n 95 million       13.52             2.44              |\n 300 million      **9.66**          1.66              |\n 300 million      17.92             3.36              |\n 1000 million     13.11             2.23              |\n 1000 million     9.73              **1.65**          |\n\n### Common Voice 9.0 testing\n\nTo evaluate this model, run the `eval.py` script in this repository:\n\n```bash\npython3 eval.py --model_id Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-xlsr-1b-finnish-lm-v2  --dataset mozilla-foundation/common_voice_9_0 --config fi --split test\n```\n\nThis model (the fift row of the table) achieves the following WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate) results compared to our other models and their parameter counts:\n\n Model parameters  WER (without LM)  CER (without LM) |\n------------------------------------------------------|\n 95 million       14.08             2.59              |\n 300 million      9.83              1.71              |\n 300 million      16.45             3.07              |\n 1000 million     13.00             2.20              |\n 1000 million     **8.96**          **1.52**          |\n\n### FLEURS ASR testing\n\nTo evaluate this model, run the `eval.py` script in this repository:\n\n```bash\npython3 eval.py --model_id Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-xlsr-1b-finnish-lm-v2 --dataset google/fleurs --config fi_fi --split test\n```\n\nThis model (the fift row of the table) achieves the following WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate) results compared to our other models and their parameter counts:\n\n Model parameters  WER (without LM)  CER (without LM) |\n------------------------------------------------------|\n 95 million       17.16             6.61              |\n 300 million      **14.63**         6.22              |\n 300 million      23.30             7.67              |\n 1000 million     16.67             6.35              |\n 1000 million     14.89             **6.06**          |\n\n## Team Members\n\n- Aapo Tanskanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n- Rasmus Toivanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n\nFeel free to contact us for more details ð¤",

The model has been fine-tuned with 259.57 hours of Finnish transcribed speech data. Wav2Vec2 XLS-R was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released at [this page](\n\nThis repository also includes Finnish KenLM language model used in the decoding phase with the acoustic model.\n\n**Note**: this model is exactly the same as the [aapot/wav2vec2-xlsr-1b-finnish-lm]( model so that model has just been copied/moved to this `Finnish-NLP` Hugging Face organization.\n\n**Note**: there is a better V2 version of this model which has been fine-tuned longer with 16 hours of more data: [Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-xlsr-1b-finnish-lm-v2](\n\n## Model description\n\nWav2Vec2 XLS-R is Facebook AI's large-scale multilingual pretrained model for speech. It is pretrained on 436k hours of unlabeled speech, including VoxPopuli, MLS, CommonVoice, BABEL, and VoxLingua107. It uses the wav2vec 2.0 objective, in 128 languages.\n\nYou can read more about the pretrained model from [this blog]( and [this paper](\n\nThis model is fine-tuned version of the pretrained model (1 billion parameter variant) for Finnish ASR.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use this model for Finnish ASR (speech-to-text) task. \n\n### How to use\n\nCheck the [run-finnish-asr-models.ipynb]( notebook in this repository for an detailed example on how to use this model.\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThis model was fine-tuned with audio samples which maximum length was 20 seconds so this model most likely works the best for quite short audios of similar length. However, you can try this model with a lot longer audios too and see how it works. If you encounter out of memory errors with very long audio files you can use the audio chunking method introduced in [this blog post](\n\nA vast majority of the data used for fine-tuning was from the Finnish Parliament dataset so this model may not generalize so well to very different domains like common daily spoken Finnish with dialects etc. In addition, audios of the datasets tend to be adult male dominated so this model may not work as well for speeches of children and women, for example.\n\nThe Finnish KenLM language model used in the decoding phase has been trained with text data from the audio transcriptions. Thus, the decoder's language model may not generalize to very different language, for example to spoken daily language with dialects. It may be beneficial to train your own KenLM language model for your domain language and use that in the decoding.\n\n## Training data\n\nThis model was fine-tuned with 259.57 hours of Finnish transcribed speech data from following datasets:\n\n Hours    \n:--------:\n 9.70 h   \n 0.24 h   \n 5.94 h   \n 10.32 h  \n 228.00 h \n 5.37 h   \n\nDatasets were filtered to include maximum length of 20 seconds long audio samples.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nThis model was trained during [Robust Speech Challenge Event]( organized by Hugging Face. Training was done on a Tesla V100 GPU, sponsored by OVHcloud.\n\nTraining script was provided by Hugging Face and it is available [here]( We only modified its data loading for our custom datasets.\n\nFor the KenLM language model training, we followed the [blog post tutorial]( provided by Hugging Face.

The model has been fine-tuned with 275.6 hours of Finnish transcribed speech data. Wav2Vec2 XLS-R was introduced in\n[this paper]( and first released at [this page](\n\nThis repository also includes Finnish KenLM language model used in the decoding phase with the acoustic model.\n\n**Note**: this model is exactly the same as the [aapot/wav2vec2-xlsr-300m-finnish-lm]( model so that model has just been copied/moved to this `Finnish-NLP` Hugging Face organization.\n\n## Model description\n\nWav2Vec2 XLS-R is Facebook AI's large-scale multilingual pretrained model for speech. It is pretrained on 436k hours of unlabeled speech, including VoxPopuli, MLS, CommonVoice, BABEL, and VoxLingua107. It uses the wav2vec 2.0 objective, in 128 languages.\n\nYou can read more about the pretrained model from [this blog]( and [this paper](\n\nThis model is fine-tuned version of the pretrained model (300 million parameter variant) for Finnish ASR.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use this model for Finnish ASR (speech-to-text) task. \n\n### How to use\n\nCheck the [run-finnish-asr-models.ipynb]( notebook in this repository for an detailed example on how to use this model.\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThis model was fine-tuned with audio samples which maximum length was 20 seconds so this model most likely works the best for quite short audios of similar length. However, you can try this model with a lot longer audios too and see how it works. If you encounter out of memory errors with very long audio files you can use the audio chunking method introduced in [this blog post](\n\nA vast majority of the data used for fine-tuning was from the Finnish Parliament dataset so this model may not generalize so well to very different domains like common daily spoken Finnish with dialects etc. In addition, audios of the datasets tend to be adult male dominated so this model may not work as well for speeches of children and women, for example.\n\nThe Finnish KenLM language model used in the decoding phase has been trained with text data from the audio transcriptions and from a subset of Finnish Wikipedia. Thus, the decoder's language model may not generalize to very different language, for example to spoken daily language with dialects (because especially the Wikipedia contains mostly formal Finnish language). It may be beneficial to train your own KenLM language model for your domain language and use that in the decoding.\n\n## Training data\n\nThis model was fine-tuned with 275.6 hours of Finnish transcribed speech data from following datasets:\n\n Hours    \n:--------:\n 9.70 h   \n 0.24 h   \n 21.97 h  \n 10.32 h  \n 228.00 h \n 5.37 h   \n\nDatasets were filtered to include maximum length of 20 seconds long audio samples.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nThis model was trained during [Robust Speech Challenge Event]( organized by Hugging Face. Training was done on a Tesla V100 GPU, sponsored by OVHcloud.\n\nTraining script was provided by Hugging Face and it is available [here]( We only modified its data loading for our custom datasets.\n\nFor the KenLM language model training, we followed the [blog post tutorial]( provided by Hugging Face. Training data for the 5-gram KenLM were text transcriptions of the audio training data and 100k random samples of cleaned [Finnish Wikipedia]( (August 2021) dataset.\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-04\n- train_batch_size: 32\n- eval_batch_size: 32\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: [8-bit Adam]( with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 500\n- num_epochs: 10\n- mixed_precision_training: Native AMP\n\nThe pretrained `facebook/wav2vec2-xls-r-300m` model was initialized with following hyperparameters:\n- attention_dropout: 0.094\n- hidden_dropout: 0.047\n- feat_proj_dropout: 0.04\n- mask_time_prob: 0.082\n- layerdrop: 0.041\n- activation_dropout: 0.055\n- ctc_loss_reduction: \"mean\"\n\n### Training results\n\n Epoch  Validation Loss \n:-----::---------------:\n 0.17   0.5750          \n 0.34   0.3356          \n 0.5    0.3007          \n 0.67   0.2619          \n 0.84   0.2488          \n 1.01   0.2795          \n 1.17   0.2652          \n 1.34   0.2479          \n 1.51   0.2409          \n 1.68   0.2728          \n 1.84   0.2254          \n 2.01   0.2169          \n 2.18   0.2215          \n 2.35   0.2174          \n 2.51   0.2217          \n 2.68   0.2002          \n 2.85   0.1935          \n 3.02   0.1859          \n 3.18   0.2038          \n 3.35   0.1863          \n 3.52   0.1948          \n 3.69   0.1872          \n 3.85   0.1888          \n 4.02   0.1818          \n 4.19   0.1896          \n 4.36   0.1953          \n 4.52   0.1864          \n 4.69   0.1843          \n 4.86   0.1686          \n 5.03   0.1731          \n 5.19   0.1676          \n 5.36   0.1740          \n 5.53   0.1674          \n 5.7    0.1735          \n 5.86   0.1692          \n 6.03   0.1797          \n 6.2    0.1651          \n 6.37   0.1627          \n 6.53   0.1652          \n 6.7    0.1564          \n 6.87   0.1525          \n 7.04   0.1639          \n 7.21   0.1611          \n 7.37   0.1633          \n 7.54   0.1692          \n 7.71   0.1555          \n 7.88   0.1590          \n 8.04   0.1531          \n 8.21   0.1583          \n 8.38   0.1546          \n 8.55   0.1540          \n 8.71   0.1534          \n 8.88   0.1482          \n 9.05   0.1490          \n 9.22   0.1463          \n 9.38   0.1454          \n 9.55   0.1504          \n 9.72   0.1512          \n 9.89   0.1484          \n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.17.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.10.2+cu102\n- Datasets 1.18.3\n- Tokenizers 0.11.0\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nEvaluation was done with the [Common Voice 7.0 Finnish test split]( [Common Voice 9.0 Finnish test split]( and with the [FLEURS ASR Finnish test split]( \n\nThis model's training data includes the training splits of Common Voice 7.0 but our newer `Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-base-fi-voxpopuli-v2-finetuned` and `Finnish-NLP/wav2vec2-large-uralic-voxpopuli-v2-finnish` models include the Common Voice 9.0 so we ran tests for both Common Voice versions.

T5 was introduced in\n[this paper](\nand first released at [this page](\n\n**Note:** The Hugging Face inference widget is deactivated because this model needs a text-to-text fine-tuning on a specific downstream task to be useful in practice. As an example of a fine-tuned Finnish T5 model, you can check [Finnish-NLP/t5-small-nl24-casing-punctuation-correction]( which has been fine-tuned to correct missing casing and punctuation for Finnish text.\n\n## Model description\n\nT5 is an encoder-decoder model and treats all NLP problems in a text-to-text format.\n\nFinnish T5 is a transformers model pretrained on a very large corpus of Finnish data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and outputs from those texts.\n\nMore precisely, it was pretrained with the span-based masked language modeling (MLM) objective. Spans of the input sequence are masked by so-called sentinel tokens (a.k.a unique mask tokens) and the output sequence is formed as a concatenation of the same sentinel tokens and the real masked tokens. This way, the model learns an inner representation of the Finnish language.\n\nThis model used the [T5 v1.1]( improvements compared to the original T5 model during the pretraining:\n- GEGLU activation in feed-forward hidden layer, rather than ReLU - see [here](\n- Dropout was turned off in pretraining (quality win). Dropout should be re-enabled during fine-tuning\n- Pretrained on span-based masked language modeling (MLM) objective only without mixing in the downstream tasks\n- No parameter sharing between embedding and classifier layer\n\nThis model also used the \"efficient\" T5 architecture findings presented in [this paper]( In a nutshell, the paper indicates that a Deep-Narrow model architecture is favorable for downstream performance compared to other model architectures of similar parameter count. To be more precise, model depth is defined as the number of transformer blocks that are stacked sequentially.\n\nThis model uses the [t5-efficient-mini-nl8]( architecture's layer depth which means both the encoder and the decoder have 8 transformer layers compared to the original T5 \"mini\" model's architecture of 4 transformer layers.\n\nIn total, this model has 72 million parameters.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis model was only pretrained in a self-supervised way excluding any supervised training. Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is usable on a downstream task, like text classification, unlike the Google's original T5 model. **Note:** You most likely need to fine-tune these T5 models without mixed precision so fine-tune them with full fp32 precision. You can also find more fine-tuning tips from [here]( for example.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Finnish-NLP/t5-mini-nl8-finnish\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"Finnish-NLP/t5-mini-nl8-finnish\")\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, TFT5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Finnish-NLP/t5-mini-nl8-finnish\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"Finnish-NLP/t5-mini-nl8-finnish\", from_pt=True)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe training data used for this model contains a lot of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral. Therefore, the model can have biased predictions. This bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThis Finnish T5 model was pretrained on the combination of six datasets:\n- [mc4_fi_cleaned]( the dataset mC4 is a multilingual colossal, cleaned version of Common Crawl's web crawl corpus. We used the Finnish subset of the mC4 dataset and further cleaned it with our own text data cleaning codes (check the dataset repo).\n- [wikipedia]( We used the Finnish subset of the wikipedia (August 2021) dataset\n- [Yle Finnish News Archive 2011-2018](\n- [Yle Finnish News Archive 2019-2020](\n- [Finnish News Agency Archive (STT)](\n- [The Suomi24 Sentences Corpus](\n\nRaw datasets were automatically cleaned to filter out bad quality and non-Finnish examples. Also, a [perplexity]( score was calculated for all texts with a KenLM model which was trained with very clean Finnish texts only. This perplexity score can then be used to determine how \"clean\" Finnish language the text contains. Lastly, all datasets were concatenated and the top 90% perplexity score was used as a filtering threshold to filter out the worst quality 10% of texts. Together these cleaned datasets were around 76GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using WordPiece and a vocabulary size of 32000. The inputs and the outputs are sequences of 512 consecutive tokens. Texts are not lower cased so this model is case-sensitive: it makes a difference between finnish and Finnish.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on TPUv3-8 VM, sponsored by the [Google TPU Research Cloud]( for 500K steps with a batch size of 256 (in total 66B tokens). The optimizer used was a AdaFactor with learning rate warmup for 10K steps with a constant learning rate of 1e-2, and then an inverse square root decay (exponential decay) of the learning rate after.\n\nTraining code was from the Google's Jax/Flax based [t5x framework]( and also some t5x task definitions were adapted from [Per's t5x work](\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nEvaluation was done by fine-tuning the model on a downstream text classification task with two different labeled Finnish datasets: [Yle News]( and [Eduskunta]( Classification fine-tuning was done with a sequence length of 128 tokens.\n\nWhen fine-tuned on those datasets, this model (the second row of the table) achieves the following accuracy results compared to our other T5 models and their parameter counts:\n\n Model parameters  Eduskunta accuracy   |\n----------------------------------------|\n 31 million       69.07                 |\n 72 million       71.43                 |\n 184 million      74.00                 |\n 260 million      74.90                 |\n 582 million      73.13                 |\n 814 million      **75.97**             |\n 1425 million     73.50                 |\n\n\nFine-tuning Google's multilingual mT5 models on the same datasets we can clearly see that our monolingual Finnish T5 models achieve much better results on Finnish text classification:\n\n Model parameters  Eduskunta accuracy   |\n----------------------------------------|\n 301 million      64.10                 |\n 583 million      68.40                 |\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project would not have been possible without compute generously provided by Google through the\n[TPU Research Cloud](\n\n## Team Members\n\n- Aapo Tanskanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n- Rasmus Toivanen, [Hugging Face profile]( [LinkedIn profile](\n\nFeel free to contact us for more details ð¤",

In addition, it also provides the pooled states of the last transformer layer. The model was created by fine-tuning [\nWav2Vec2-Large-Robust]( on [MSP-Podcast]( (v1.7). The model was pruned from 24 to 12 transformer layers before fine-tuning.

However, there is still a large performance drop for languages unseen during pre-training, especially African languages. One of the most effective approaches to adapt to a new language is language adaptive fine-tuning (LAFT) {---} fine-tuning a multilingual PLM on monolingual texts of a language using the pre-training objective. However, adapting to target language individually takes large disk space and limits the cross-lingual transfer abilities of the resulting models because they have been specialized for a single language. In this paper, we perform multilingual adaptive fine-tuning on 17 most-resourced African languages and three other high-resource languages widely spoken on the African continent to encourage cross-lingual transfer learning. To further specialize the multilingual PLM, we removed vocabulary tokens from the embedding layer that corresponds to non-African writing scripts before MAFT, thus reducing the model size by around 50{\\%}. Our evaluation on two multilingual PLMs (AfriBERTa and XLM-R) and three NLP tasks (NER, news topic classification, and sentiment classification) shows that our approach is competitive to applying LAFT on individual languages while requiring significantly less disk space. Additionally, we show that our adapted PLM also improves the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer abilities of parameter efficient fine-tuning methods.\",\n}\n```\n\n\n",
